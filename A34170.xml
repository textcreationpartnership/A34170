            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WITH all poſſible Reſpect, and ſome Hopes it will not prove abſolutely unwelcom, I Humbly lay at Your Majeſty's Feet a very good Book, but a very ill-ſuited Preſent: For Devout Ink and Paper to Your Majeſty, whoſe Life is it ſelf a Book of Devotion, is
<pb facs="tcp:110737:3"/>but a Link of Silver to a Chain of Gold. And then a Tranſlation is ſuch a kind of Preſent to Your Majeſty, as a bad Copy to one who has an excellent Original. 'Tis true, you are an abſolute Miſtreſs of our Language, as well as Hearts; but you would never Pray in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue, though there were neither <hi>Engliſh</hi> nor <hi>Italian</hi> in the World; and Tranſlating is but telling you a Story for News, which you know already, and hear when you pleaſe much better told. But ſince what is uſeleſs to Your Majeſty, may be beneficial to your Subjects; and a Queen is neither the Greateſt, nor the moſt Glorious of your Titles, I promiſe my ſelf that your Charity will condeſcend
<pb facs="tcp:110737:3"/>to make an Alms of your Name and Patronage; and by your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to Devotion, allure a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fond of making their Court to you, to make it in the way moſt pleaſing to Your Majeſty, ſtraining to follow afar off, and be as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout as they can, ſince few can hope to be as Devout as you.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be hoped this will be the Courtſhip in faſhion, now the Times are returned in which the Queens of <hi>England</hi> are Saints again; and the Fruit infinitely great, when People find the way to Heaven, is the way to be well at Court. I was Ambitious to make my Court this way, but to my ſhame, ſo poor a Courtier, that I was forc'd to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Preſent, and to make it mine,
<pb facs="tcp:110737:4"/>dreſs'd in a new Language, as we alter the property of Plate by a new Faſhion. I know I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd my unskilfulneſs in this Trade to the Eye in all <hi>England,</hi> which will the ſooneſt diſcern it. But Your Majeſty will have the goodneſs to reflect, that no Tranſlation can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the beauty and force of the Original; to ſuffer the Argument to attone for all Faults, and to have ſome Indulgence for the Paſſionate Zeal and Profound Reſpect, with which I ſhall always be,</p>

                     <p>IT has been an Ancient Practice in the Church, even among the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, for the Prieſt before Maſs, at Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and Whitſontide, to ſprinkle the People with Water out of the Font, bleſt with the Prayers and Exorciſms the Eve of thoſe Holy Days, and there reſerved till Holy Oyl was poured therein.</p>
                     <p>And to the end the Faithful ſhould not eſteem this ſprinkling a ſecond Baptiſm, the Church has inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted particular Bleſſings, and Exorciſms of Water and Salt for each Sunday through the Year, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, That by this ſprinkling ſhe gives us no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110737:6"/>Baptiſm, but that ſhe applies her Prayers to obtain of God, through the Merits of JESUS CHRIST, (if we our ſelves are not the obſtacle) the grace of true repentance for our ſins, and a guard from the aſſaults of the Devil, that ſo we may preſerve our ſelves in that ſtate of innocence we received by Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>By the Water the Church tells us, ſhe prays to God, and that we are therein to concur with her, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to purifie our Souls by his Grace, as the Water cleanſeth our Bodies. And by the Salt ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents her Prayer to God, wherein we ought alſo to joyn for obtaining his Grace, to preſerve our Souls from ſpiritual corruption, as Salt preſerves the Body from corporal. And as Salt gives an agreeable taſt to our Meat, ſo his Grace renders our actions accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his Majeſty, preſerving us from falling into thoſe ſins wherewith the Devil might otherwiſe infect us, whereby we may more worthily be aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant at the Holy Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of CHRIST, and reap the benefit thereof.</p>

                     <p>AT that time Jeſus ſaid to his Diſciples, You know that after two days ſhall be Paſche, and the Son of man ſhall be delivered to be crucified. Then were gathered together the Chief Prieſts and Ancients of the People into the Court of the High Prieſt, who was called <hi>Caiaphas:</hi> And they conſulted how they might by ſome guile apprehend Jeſus, and kill him; But they ſaid, Not on the Feſtival-day, leſt perhaps there might be a tumult among the people. And when Jeſus was in <hi>Bethania,</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the leper, there came to him a Woman, having an Alabaſter Box of Precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and poured it out upon his Head, as he ſat at the Table. And the Diſciples ſeeing it, had indignation, ſaying, Whereto is this waſte? for this might have been ſold for much, and given to the poor. And Jeſus knowing it, ſaid to them, Why do you mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt this Woman? for ſhe hath wrought a good work upon me; for the poor you have always with you, but me you have not always, for ſhe, in pouring this Oyntment upon my Body, hath done it to bury me. Amen, I ſay to you;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110737:27"/>whereſoever this Goſpel ſhall be preached in the whole World, that alſo ſhe hath done, ſhall be reported for a memory of her. Then went one of the twelve, which was called <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> to the Chief Prieſts, and ſaid to them, what will you give me, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him unto you? But they appointed unto him Thirty Pieces of Silver. And from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth he ſought opportunity to betray him. And the firſt day of the Azymes the Diſciples cames to Jeſus, ſaying, Where wilt thou that we prepare the Paſche? But Jeſus ſaid, Go into the City to a certain man, and ſay to him, the Maſter ſaith, My time is at hand, with thee do I make the Paſche with my Diſciples. And the Diſciples did as Jeſus appointed them, and they prepared the Paſche. But when it was even, he ſate down with his twelve Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; And while they were eating, he ſaid, Amen, I ſay unto you, That one of you ſhall betray me. And they being very ſad, began every one to ſay, Is it I, Lord? but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, ſaid, He that dippeth his hand with me in the Diſh, he ſhall betray me. The Son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him; but wo be to that man by whom the Son of man ſhall be betrayed; it were good for him if that man had not been born. And <hi>Judas,</hi> that betrayed him, ſaid, Is it I, Rabbi? he ſaith to him, Thou haſt ſaid. And whiles they were at Supper, Jeſus took Bread, and bleſſed,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:110737:27"/>and brake; and he gave to his Diſciples, and ſaid, Take ye, and eat; this is my Body. And taking the Chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, ſaying, drink ye all of this; for this is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which ſhall be ſhed for many unto remiſſion of ſins. And I ſay unto you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the Wine, until that day when I ſhall drink it with you new in the Kingdom of my Father. And an Hymn being ſaid, they went forth unto Mount <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet.</hi> Then Jeſus ſaid to them, All you ſhall be ſcandalized in me this night: For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I will ſtrike the Paſtor, and the ſheep of the flock ſhall be diſperſed; but after I ſhall be riſen again, I will go before you into <hi>Galilee.</hi> And <hi>Peter,</hi> anſwering, ſaid to him, Although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſcandalized. Jeſus ſaid to him, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I ſay to thee, that in this night, before the Cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to him, Yea, though I ſhould die with thee, I will not deny thee. Likewiſe alſo ſaid all the Diſciples. Then Jeſus cometh with them into a Village called <hi>Gethſemani;</hi> and he ſaid to his Diſciples, Sit you here, while I go yonder, and pray. And taking to him <hi>Peter,</hi> and the two Sons of <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> he began to wax ſorrowful, even unto death; ſtay here and watch with me. And, being gone forward a little, he fell upon his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110737:28"/>face, praying, and ſaying, My Father, if it be poſſible, let this Chalice paſs from me; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou. And he cometh to his Diſciples, and findeth them ſleeping; and he ſaith to <hi>Peter,</hi> Even ſo? could you not watch one hour with me? Watch ye, and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The ſpirit indeed is prompt, but the fleſh weak. Again, the ſecond time he went, and prayed, ſaying, My Father, if this Chalice may not paſs, but I muſt drink it, thy will be done. And he cometh again, and findeth them ſleeping; for their eyes were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come heavy. And leaving them, he went again, and he prayed the third time, ſaying, the ſelf-ſame word. Then he cometh to his Diſciples, and ſaith to them, Sleep ye now, and take reſt; behold, the hour approacheth, and the Son of man ſhall be betrayed into the hands of ſinners. Riſe, let us go; behold, he approacheth, that ſhall betray me. As he yet ſpake, behold <hi>Judas,</hi> one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with Swords and Clubs, ſent from the Chief Prieſts and the Ancients of the People. And he that betrayed him, gave them a ſign, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whomſoever I ſhall kiſs, that is he, hold him. And forthwith, coming to Jeſus, he ſaid, Hail, Rabbi, and he kiſſed him. And Jeſus ſaid to him, Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they drew neer, and laid hands
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110737:28"/>on Jeſus, and held him, and behold, one of them that were with Jeſus, ſtretching forth his hand, drew out his ſword, and ſtriking the ſervant of the High Prieſt, cut off his ear. Then Jeſus ſaid to him, Return thy ſword into his place; for all that take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword. Thinkeſt thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me preſently more than twelve legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? How then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that ſo it muſt be done? In that hour Jeſus ſaid to the multitudes, You are come out as it were to a thief, with Swords and Clubs to apprehend me: I ſate daily with you teaching in the Temple, and you laid no hands on me. And this was done, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Prophets might be fulfilled. Then the Diſciples all leaving him, fled. But they, taking hold of Jeſus, led him to <hi>Caiphas</hi> the High Prieſt, where the Scribes and Ancients were aſſembled: And <hi>Peter</hi> followed him afar off, even to the Court of the High Prieſt; and going in, he ſate with the ſervants, that he might ſee the end. And the Chief Prieſts and whole Council ſought falſe witneſs againſt Jeſus, that they might put him to death; and they found not, whereas many falſe witneſſes had come in. And laſt of all, there came two falſe witneſſes, and they ſaid, This man ſaid, I am able to deſtroy the Temple of God, and, after three days, to re-edifie it. And the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110737:29"/>High Prieſt, riſing up, ſaid to him, Anſwereſt thou nothing to the things which theſe do teſtifie againſt thee? But Jeſus held his peace. And the High Prieſt ſaid to him, I adjure thee, by the living God, that thou tell us, if thou be Chriſt, the Son of God. Jeſus ſaid to him, Thou haſt ſaid. Nevertheleſs I ſay to you, Hereafter you ſhall ſee the Son of man ſitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of Heaven. Then the High Prieſt rent his garments, ſaying, He hath blaſphemed, what need we witneſſes any further? Behold, now ye have heard the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy; how think you? But they anſwering, ſaid, He is guilty of death. Then did they ſpit on his face, and buffeted him, and others ſmote his face with the palms of their hands, ſaying, Propheſie unto us, O Chriſt, who is he that ſtruck thee? But <hi>Peter</hi> ſate without the court, and there came to him one wench, ſaying. Thou alſo waſt with Jeſus the <hi>Galilean:</hi> but he denied before them all, ſaying, I wot not what thou ſayeſt. And, as he went out of the gate, another wench ſaw him, and ſhe ſaid to them that were there, And this fellow alſo was with Jeſus the <hi>Nazarite;</hi> and again he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, with an Oath, that he knew not the man. And, after a while, they came that ſtood by, and ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> Surely thou alſo art of them, for even thy ſpeech doth betray thee. Then he began to curſe and to ſwear, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110737:29"/>he knew not the man. And incontinent the Cock crew. And <hi>Peter</hi> remembred the word of Jeſus which he had ſaid, Before the Cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice; And going forth, he wept bitterly. And when morning was come, all the Chief Prieſts and Ancients of the people conſulted together againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that they might put him to death. And they brought him bound, and delivered him to <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> the preſident. Then <hi>Judas,</hi> that betrayed him, ſeeing that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, repenting him, returned the thirty ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pieces to the Chief Prieſts and Ancients, ſaying, I have ſinned, betraying juſt blood. But they ſaid, What is that to us? Look thou to it. And caſting down the ſilver pieces in the Temple, he departed, and went and hanged himſelf with an halter. And the Chief Prieſts, having taken the ſilver pieces, ſaid, It is not lawful to caſt them into the <hi>Corbana;</hi> becauſe it is the price of blood. And after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted together, they bought with them the potters field, to be a burying place for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. For this cauſe that field was called <hi>Hacel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dama;</hi> that is, the field of blood, even to this preſent day. Then was filled that which was ſpoken by <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet, ſaying, And they took the thirty pieces of ſilver, the price of the prized, whom they did prize of the Children of Iſrael; and they gave them into the potters field, as the Lord did appoint
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110737:30"/>to me. And Jeſus ſtood before the Preſident, and the Preſident asked him, ſaying, Art thou the King of the <hi>Jews?</hi> Jeſus ſaith to him, Thou ſayeſt. And when he was accuſed of the Chief Prieſts and Ancients, he anſwered nothing. Then <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaith to him, Doeſt thou not hear how great teſtimonies they alledge againſt thee? And he anſwered him not to any word, ſo that the Preſident did marvel exceedingly. And upon the ſolemn day the Preſident had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to releaſe unto the people one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, whom they would. And he had then a notorious priſoner, that was called <hi>Barabbas;</hi> they therefore being gathered together, <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid, Whom will you that I releaſe to you? <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas,</hi> or Jeſus, that is called Chriſt? For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. And as he was ſitting in place of judgment, his wife ſent unto him, ſaying. Have thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with that juſt man, for I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered many things this day in my ſleep for him. But the Chief Prieſts and Ancients per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the people, that they ſhould ask <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas,</hi> and make Jeſus away. And the Preſident, anſwering, ſaid, to them, Whether will you of the two to be releaſed unto you? But they ſaid <hi>Barabbas. Pilate</hi> ſaid to them, What ſhall I do then with Jeſus, that is called Chriſt. They ſaid all, Let him be crucified. The Preſident ſaid to them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried the more, ſaying, Let him be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110737:30"/>And <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſeeing that he nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, but rather a tumult was toward, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king water, he waſhed his hands before the people, ſaying, I am innocent of the blood of this juſt man; look you to it. And the whole people, anſwering, ſaid, His blood be upon us and upon our children. Then he releaſed to them <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and having ſcourged Jeſus, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him unto them to be crucified. Then the Preſident's ſouldiers, taking Jeſus into the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, gathered together unto him the whole band; and ſtripping him, put a ſcarlet cloak about him, and platting a crown of thorns, put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, ſaying, Hail, King of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and ſpitting upon him, they took the reed and ſmote his head. And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucifie him. And in going they found a man of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> named <hi>Simon,</hi> whom they forced to take up his Croſs. And they came into the place which is called <hi>Golgotha,</hi> which is the place of <hi>Calvari.</hi> And they gave him Wine to drink, mingled with Gall. And when he taſted, he would not drink. And after they had crucified him, they divided his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, caſting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken to the Prophet, ſaying, They divided my garments among them, and upon
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110737:31"/>my veſture they did caſt lots. And they ſate and watched him. And they put over his head his cauſe written, This is Jeſus the King of the Jews. Then were crucified with him two thieves; one on the right hand, and one of the left; And they paſſed by, blaſpheming him, wagging their heads, and ſaying, Vah, Thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three days doeſt re-edifie it, ſave thine own ſelf: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the Croſs. In like manner alſo the Chief Prieſts, with the Scribes and Ancients mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid, He ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave: if he be King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> let him now come down from the Croſs, and we will believe him. He truſted in God, let him now deliver him, if he will: for he ſaid, That I am the Son of God. And the ſelf-ſame thing the thieves alſo that were crucified with him, reproached him withal. And from the ſixth hour there was darkneſs made upon the whole earth, until the ninth hour Jeſus cryed out with a mighty voice ſaying, Eli, Eli Lamaſabacthani? that is, my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</p>

                     <ab type="commentary">The Church teacheth us by this Propheſie, that Jeſus Chriſt, who neither had or could commit a ſin, had not ſuffered death, but that he voluntarily expoſed himſelf thereto, taking our ſins upon him, to free us and make ſatisfaction for us to the Divine Juſtice. No circumſtance of his Paſſion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from him. He foreſaw all the hardſhips and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and though humane nature were againſt it, yet he freely ſubmitted himſelf to the will of his Father, which he alſo faithfully performed. But in ſuffering for us he hath left an Example and Obligation upon us to imitate him in afflictions, with a perfect ſubmiſſion to the will of God and an entire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his bounty.</ab>
                     <p>IN thoſe days ſaid <hi>Iſaias,</hi> The Lord God hath opened my ear, and I do not gainſay: I am not gone backward. I have given my body to the ſtrikers, and my cheeks to the pluckers. I have not turned away my face from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukers and ſpitters. The Lord God is my
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110737:49"/>helper, therefore am I not confounded. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have I ſet my face as a moſt hard rock, and I know that I ſhall not be confounded. He is near that juſtifies me, who ſhall gainſay me? Let us ſtand together, who is my adverſary? let him come to me. Behold, the Lord God, my helper, who is he that ſhall contemn me? lo, they ſhall all be deſtroyed as a garment; the moth ſhall eat them. Which of you fears our Lord, hears the voice of his ſervant. Who hath walked in darkneſs and hath no light, let him hope in the Name of our Lord, and lean upon his God.</p>

                     <p>AT that time the Paſche was, and Azymes after two days, and the Chief Prieſts and the Scribes ſought how they might by ſome guile lay hands on Jeſus, and kill him. But they ſaid, Not on the feſtival-day, leſt there might be a tumult of the people. And when he was at <hi>Bethania,</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the leper, and ſate at meat, there came a woman, having an alabaſter box of Oyntment of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Spiknard, and breaking the alabaſter box, ſhe poured it upon his head. But there were certain that had indignation within themſelves, and ſaid, Whereto is this waſte of Oyntment made? for this Oyntment might have been ſold for more than three hundred pence, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the poor. And they murmured againſt her. But Jeſus ſaid, Let her alone, why do you moleſt her? ſhe hath wrought a good work upon me; for the poor you have always with you; and when you will you may do them good: but me you have not always. That which ſhe had ſhe hath done: ſhe hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to anoint my body to the burial. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I ſay to you, Whereſoever this Goſpel ſhall be preached in the whole world, that alſo which ſhe hath done, ſhall be told for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of her. And <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> one of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:110737:55"/>twelve, went his way to the Chief Prieſts, for to betray him to them. Who hearing it, were glad: and they promiſed him, that they would give him money. And he ſought how he might betray him conveniently. And the firſt day of the Azymes, when they ſacrificed the Paſche, the Diſciples ſay to him, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the Paſche? And he ſendeth two of his Diſciples, and ſaith to them, Go ye into the City, and there ſhall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him: and whitherſoever he entreth, ſay to the maſter of the houſe, the maſter ſaith, Where is my Refectory, where I may eat the Paſche with my Diſciples? And he will ſhew you a great cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber adorned: and there prepare for us. And his Diſciples went their ways, and came into the city: and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the Paſche. And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve And when they were ſitting at the table, and eating, Jeſus ſaid, Amen, I ſay to you, that one of you ſhall betray me, he that eateth with me. But they began to be ſad, and to ſay to him ſeverally, Is it I? Who ſaid to them, One of the twelve, he dippeth with me his hand in the diſh. And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him; but wo to that man, by whom the Son of man ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed; it were good for him, if that man had
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:110737:55"/>not been born. And while they were eating, Jeſus took bread, and bleſſing, brake, and gave to them, and ſaid, Take, this is my body. And taking the chalice, giving thanks, he gave to them, and they all drank of it. And he ſaid to them, This is my blood of the New Teſtament, that ſhall be ſhed for many. Amen, I ſay to you, that now I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I ſhall drink it new in the kingdom of God. And, an hymn being ſaid, they went forth into <hi>Mount Olivet.</hi> And Jeſus ſaid to them, You ſhall all be ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in me this night: for it is written, I will ſtrike the Paſtor, and the ſheep ſhall be diſperſed. But after that I ſhall be riſen again, I will go before you into <hi>Galilee.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to him, Although all ſhall be ſcandalized, yet not I. And Jeſus ſaid to him, Amen, I ſay to thee, That thou this day, in this night, before the cock crow twice, ſhalt thrice deny me. But he ſpake more vehemently, Although I ſhould die to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner alſo ſaid they all. And they came into a farm-place, called <hi>Gethſemani.</hi> And he ſaid to his Diſciples, Sit you here, until I pray. And he taketh <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> with him, and he began to fear, and to be heavy. And he ſaid to them, My ſoul is ſorrowful even unto death: ſtay here, and watch. And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat upon the ground: and he prayed, that, if it might be, the hour
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:110737:56"/>might paſs from him. And he ſaid, <hi>Abba.</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all things are poſſible to thee, transfer this Chalice from me: but not that which I will, but that which thou. And he cometh, and findeth them ſleeping. And he ſaith to <hi>Peter, Simon,</hi> ſleepeſt thou? Couldſt thou not watch one hour? Watch ye and pray, that you enter not into tentation. The ſpirit indeed is prompt, but the fleſh infirm. And going away again, he prayed, ſaying the ſelf-ſame word. And returning again, he found them aſleep, for their eyes were heavy: and they wiſt not what they ſhould anſwer him. And he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the third time, and ſaith to them, Sleep ye now, and take reſt; it ſufficeth, the hour is come, behold the Son of man ſhall be betrayed into the hands of ſinners. Ariſe, let us go; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, he that ſhall betray me, is at hand. And, as he was yet ſpeaking, cometh <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> one of the twelve, and with him a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, with ſwords and clubs, from the Chief Prieſts, and the Scribes, and the Ancients. And the betrayer of him had given them a ſign, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whomſoever I ſhall kiſs, it is he, lay hold on him, and lead him warily. And when he was come, immediately going to him, he ſaith, <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and he kiſſed him: but they laid hands upon him, and held him. And one certain man of the ſtanders about, drawing out a ſword, ſmote the ſervant of the Chief Prieſts, and cut off his ear. And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid to them, As to a thief,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110737:56"/>are you come out with ſwords and clubs, to apprehend me? I was daily with you in the Temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But that the Scriptures may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. Then his Diſciples leaving him, all fled. And a certain young man followed him, cloathed with a ſindon upon the bare; and they took him. But he, caſting off the ſindon, fled from them naked. And they brought Jeſus to the Chief Prieſt, and all the Prieſts, and the Scribes, and the Ancients aſſembled together. And <hi>Peter</hi> followed him afar off, even in unto the Court of the High Prieſt, and he ſate with the ſervants at the fire, and warmed himſelf. And the Chief Prieſts and all the Councel ſought teſtimony againſt Jeſus, that they might put him to death; neither found they, for many ſpake falſe witneſs againſt him, and the teſtimonies were not convenient. And certain riſing up, bare falſe witneſs againſt him, ſaying, That we heard him ſay, I will diſſolve this Temple made with hand, and in three days will I build another not made with hand. And their teſtimony was not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. And the High Prieſt riſing up into the mids, asked Jeſus, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to theſe things that are objected againſt thee by theſe? But he held his peace, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered nothing. Again the High Prieſt asked him, and ſaid to him, Art thou Chriſt, the Son of the bleſſed God? And Jeſus ſaith to him, I
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:110737:57"/>am. And you ſhall ſee the Son of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. And the High Prieſt, renting his garment, ſaith, What need we wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes any further? You have heard blaſphemy, how think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death. And certain began to ſpit upon him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with buffets, and to ſay unto him, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. And the ſervants gave him blows. And when <hi>Peter</hi> was in the Court beneath, there cometh one of the woman-ſervants of the High Prieſt; And when ſhe had ſeen <hi>Peter</hi> warming himſelf, beholding him, ſhe ſaith, And thou waſt with Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, ſaying. Neither know I, neither wot I what thou ſayeſt. And he went forth before the Court, and the Cock crew. And again, a wench ſeeing him, began to ſay to the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders about, that this fellow is of them. But he denied again. And, after a while again, they that ſtood by, ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> Verily thou art of them, for thou art a <hi>Galilean.</hi> But he began to curſe and to ſwear, that I know not this man whom you ſpeak of. And immediately the Cock crew again. And <hi>Peter</hi> remembred the word that Jeſus ſaid unto him, Before the Cock crow twice, thou ſhalt thrice deny me; and he began to weep. And forthwith, in the morning, the Chief Prieſts, with the Ancients and the Scribes, and the whole Councel, conſulting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:110737:57"/>binding Jeſus, led him and delivered him to <hi>Pilate.</hi> And <hi>Pilate</hi> asked him, Art thou the King of the <hi>Jews?</hi> But he anſwering, ſaid to him, Thou ſayeſt. And the Chief Prieſts accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him in many things. And <hi>Pilate</hi> again asked him, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou nothing? See in how many things they accuſe thee. But Jeſus anſwered nothing more; ſo that <hi>Pilate</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled. And upon the feſtival-day he was wont to releaſe unto them one of the priſoners, whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they had demanded. And there was one called <hi>Barabbas,</hi> who was put in priſon with ſeditious perſons, who in a ſedition had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted murther. And when the multitude was come up, they began to require according as always he did unto them. And <hi>Pilate</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, and ſaid, Will you, that I releaſe to you the King of the <hi>Jews?</hi> for he knew that the Chief Prieſts for envy had delivered him. But the Chief Prieſts moved the people, that he ſhould releaſe <hi>Barabbas</hi> rather to them. And <hi>Pilate</hi> again anſwering, ſaid to them, What will you then that I do to the King of the <hi>Jews?</hi> But they again cryed, Crucifie him. And <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid to them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cryed the more, Crucifie him. And <hi>Pilate,</hi> willing to ſatisfie the people, releaſed to them <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and having whipped Jeſus, delivered him to be crucified. And the ſouldiers led him into the court of the Palace, and they call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole band: and they cloath him in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:110737:58"/>purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him. And they began to ſalute him, Hail, King of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And they ſmote his head with a reed; and they did ſpit on him, and bowing the knees, they adored him. And after they had mocked him, they ſtripped him of the purple, and put on him his own gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and they led him forth to crucifie him. And they forced a certain man that paſſed by, <hi>Simon</hi> a <hi>Cyrenean</hi> coming from the countrey, the father of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Rufus,</hi> to take up his croſs. And they bring him into the place <hi>Golgotha,</hi> which, being interpreted, is, The place of <hi>Calvari.</hi> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; and he took it not. And, crucifying him, they divided his garments, caſting lots upon them, who ſhould take which. And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. And the title of his cauſe was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, King of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And with him they crucified two thieves, one on the right hand, another on the leſt. And the Scripture was fulfilled that ſaith, And with the wicked he was reputed. And they that paſſed by, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, wagging their heads, and ſaying, Vah, he that deſtroyeth the Temple, and in three days buildeth it, ſave thy ſelf, coming down from the croſs. In like manner alſo the Chief Prieſts mocking, ſaid with the Scribes one to another. He ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave. Let Chriſt, the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> come
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:110737:58"/>now down from the croſs, that we may ſee and believe. And they that were crucified with him, railed at him. And when it was the ſixth hour, there was made darkneſs upon the whole earth until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jeſus cried out with a mighty voice, ſaying, <hi>Eloi, Eloi, lamaſabacthani?</hi> Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? And certain of the ſtanders about hearing, ſaid, Behold he calleth <hi>Elias.</hi> And one running and filling a ſpunge with vinegar, and putting it about a reed, gave him drink, ſaying, Let be; let us ſee if <hi>Elias</hi> come to take him down. And Jeſus, putting forth a mighty voice, gave up the ghoſt.</p>

The Angels are thereunto obliged, for though Chriſt died not for them, yet mankind being thereby redeemed, they reap ſome advantage, being reconciled unto them after the enmity and ſeparation which ſin had cauſed between them, and for that by this Redemption of man the loſs and fall of the Angels was repaired.</ab>

After this Prophet hath foretold many of the torments to be endured by this man of God,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:110737:64"/>he teacheth us, firſt, that our ſins were the cauſe of his ſufferings, by which he was to ſatisfie for us to his Fathers juſtice. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he offered himſelf to theſe pains as a voluntary Victim for our ſalvation, and would ſuffer death thereby to purchaſe life for us. Thirdly, that in compenſation of this his humility and ſufferings, he is raiſed above all Creatures in Heaven ſitting on the right hand of God his Father. Fourthly, that God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath beſtowed upon him all thoſe for his children who are predeſtinated to glory, as the precious off-ſpring of his bloud which he ſo freely ſhed, that even he was pleaſed to waſh thoſe in it that put him to death, according to the Prayer as he made, even when he was nailed on the Croſs between the two Thieves.</ab>
                     <p>IN thoſe days ſaid <hi>Iſaias,</hi> Who hath believed our hearing? and the arm of our Lord, to whom is it revealed? And he ſhall come up as a young Spring before him, and as a Root from a thirſty ground. There is no beauty in him, nor comlineſs; and we have ſeen him, and there was no ſightlineſs, and we were deſirous of him. Deſpiſed and moſt abject of men; a man of ſorrows, and knowing infirmity: and his look as it were hid and deſpiſed, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neither have we eſteemed him. He ſurely hath born our infirmities, and our ſorrows he hath carried: and we thought him as it were a Leper and ſtrucken of God, and humbled. But he was wounded for our iniquities, he was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for our ſins, the diſcipline of our peace was upon him, and with the wait of his ſtripes we are healed. All we have ſtrayed as Sheep; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one hath declined into his own way: and our Lord hath put upon him the iniquity of all us. He was offered, becauſe himſelf would, and opened not his mouth: As a Sheep to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:110737:65"/>ſlaughter was he led, and as a Lamb before his Shearer, he ſhall be dumb, and ſhall not open his mouth. From diſtreſs and from judgment, he was taken up: Who ſhall declare his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? becauſe he is cut out of the Land of the living. For the wickedneſs of my people have I ſtrucken him. And he ſhall give the impious for his burial, and the rich for his death: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not done iniquity, neither was their guile in his mouth. And our Lord would break him in infirmity. If he ſhall put away his Soul for ſin, he ſhall ſee ſeed of long age; and the will of our Lord ſhall be directed in his hand: for that his Soul hath laboured, he ſhall ſee and be filled. In his knowledge the ſame my juſt ſervant ſhall juſtifie many, and he ſhall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I diſtribute unto him very many, and he ſhall divide the ſpoils of the ſtrong: for that he hath delivered his Soul unto death, and was reputed with the wicked; and he hath born the ſin of many, and hath prayed for the tranſgreſſiors.</p>

                        <hi>Judas</hi> that was ſirnamed <hi>Iſcariot,</hi> one of the twelve: And he went and talked with the chief Prieſts and the Magiſtrates, how he might betray him to them. And they were glad, and bargained to give him money. And he promiſed. And he ſought opportunity to betray him apart from the multitudes. And the day of the Azymes came, wherein it was neceſſary that the Paſche ſhould be killed. And he ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> ſaying, Go and prepare us the Paſche, that we may eat. But they ſaid, Where wilt thou that we prepare it? And he ſaid to them, Behold, as you enter into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there ſhall meet you a man carrying a Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of water, follow him into the houſe into which he entereth; and you ſhall ſay to the good man of the houſe, The Maſter ſaith to thee, Where is the Inn where I may eat the Paſche with my Diſciples? And he will ſhew you a great Refectory adorned, and there prepare. And they going, found as he ſaid to them, and prepared the Paſche. And when the hour was come, he ſate down, and the twelve Apoſtles with him, and he ſaid to them, With deſire I have deſired to eat this Paſche with you, before I ſuffer. For I ſay to you, That from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. And taking the Chalice, he gave thanks, and ſaid, Take and divide among you; for I ſay to you, That I will not drink of the generation of the Vine, till the Kingdom of God
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:110737:66"/>do come. And taking Bread, he gave thanks, and brake, and gave to them, ſaying, This is my Body which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me. In like manner the Chalice alſo, after he had ſupped, ſaying, This is the Chalice of the New Teſtament in my Bloud, which ſhall be ſhed for you. But yet behold the hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the Table. And the Son of man indeed goeth according to that which is determined: but yet wo to that man by whom he ſhall be betrayed. And they began to queſtion among themſelves, which of them it ſhould be that ſhould do this. And there fell alſo a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them, which of them ſeemed to be greater.

But you not ſo, but he that is the greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, let him become as the younger; and he that is the leader, as the waiter. For which is greater, he that ſitteth at Table, or he that miniſtreth? Is not he that ſitteth? But I am in the midſt of you, as he that miniſtreth, and you are they that have remained with me in my temptation. And I diſpoſe to you, as my Father diſpoſed to me, a Kingdom; that you may eat and drink upon my Table in my Kingdom, and may ſit upon Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And our Lord ſaid, <hi>Simon, Simon,</hi> behold Satan required to have you

And he ſaid, I ſay unto thee, <hi>Peter,</hi> the Cock ſhall not crow to day, till thou deny thrice thou knoweſt me. And he ſaid to them, When I ſent you without purſe, and skrip, and ſhoes, did you lack any thing? But ſaid, Nothing. He ſaid therefore unto them, But now he that hath a purſe, let him take it, likewiſe alſo a skrip; and he that hath not, let him ſell his coat and buy a ſword. For I ſay to you, That yet this that is written, muſt be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in me. And with the wicked was he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: For thoſe things that are concerning me, have an end. But they ſaid, Lord, lo two ſwords here. But he ſaid to them, It is enough. And going forth, he went according to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom into Mount <hi>Olivet;</hi> and his Diſciples alſo followed him.

And he was pulled away from them a ſtones caſt; and kneeling, he prayed, ſaying, Father, if thou wilt, transfer this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice from me. But yet not my will, but thine be done. And there appeared to him an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from Heaven ſtrengthening him, and being in an agony, he prayed the longer. And his ſweat became as drops of bloud trickling down upon the Earth. And when he was riſen up
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:110737:67"/>from prayer, and was come to his Diſciples, he found them ſleeping for penſiveneſs. And he ſaid to them, Why ſleep you? Ariſe, pray, leſt you enter into temptation. As he was yet ſpeaking, behold a multitude, and he that was called <hi>Judas,</hi> one of the twelve, went before them, and approached to Jeſus, for to kiſs him. And Jeſus ſaid to him, <hi>Judas,</hi> with a kiſs, doſt thou betray the Son of man? And they that were about him, ſeeing what would be, ſaid to him, Lord, ſhall we ſtrike with the ſword? And one of them ſmote the ſervant of the High Prieſt, and cut off his right ear. But Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, ſaid, Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him. And Jeſus ſaid to them, that were come unto him, the Chief Prieſts and Magiſtrates of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Ancients, As it were to a thief, are you come forth with ſwords and clubs? when I was daily with you in the Temple, you did not lay hands upon me, but this is your hour, and the power of darkneſs. And, apprehending him, they led him to the High Prieſts houſe; but <hi>Peter</hi> followed afar off. And, a fire being kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in the mids of the court, and they ſitting about it, <hi>Peter</hi> was in the mids of them. Whom, when a certain wench ſaw, ſitting at the light, and had beheld him, ſhe ſaid, This fellow was alſo with him. But he denied him, ſaying, Woman, I know him not. And, after a while, another man ſeeing him, ſaid, And thou
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:110737:68"/>art of them. But <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, O man I am not. And after the ſpace as it were of one hour, a certain other man affirmed, ſaying, Verily, this fellow alſo was with him, for he is alſo a <hi>Galilean.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, Man, I know not what thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. And incontinent as he was yet ſpeaking, the Cock crew. And our Lord turning, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Peter.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> remembred the word of our Lord, as he had ſaid, That before the Cock crow, thou ſhalt thrice deny me. And <hi>Peter,</hi> going forth adoors, wept bitterly. And the men that held him, mocked him, beating him. And they did blindfold him, and ſmote his face. And they asked him, ſaying, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, who is he that ſmote thee? And, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, many other things they ſaid againſt him. And when it was day, there aſſembled the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of the people, and Chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and they brought him into their council, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If thou be Chriſt, tell us. And he ſaid to them, If I tell you, you will not believe me: If alſo I ask, you will not anſwer me. But from henceforth the Son of man ſhall be ſitting on the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid, Art thou then the Son of God? Who ſaith, You ſay that I am. But they ſaid, What need we teſtimony any further? for your ſelves have heard of his own mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing up, led him to <hi>Pilate.</hi> And they began to accuſe him, ſaying, We have found this man ſubverting our nation,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:110737:68"/>and prohibiting to give tributes to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and ſaying, That he is Chriſt the King. And <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> asked him, ſaying, Art thou the King of the <hi>Jews?</hi> But he anſwering, ſaid, Thou ſayeſt. And <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid to the Chief Prieſts and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, I find no cauſe in this man. But they were the more earneſt, ſaying, He ſtirreth the people, teaching throughout all <hi>Jewry,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from <hi>Galilee,</hi> even hither. But <hi>Pilate</hi> hearing <hi>Galilee,</hi> Asked if the man were of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee?</hi> And when he underſtood, that he was of <hi>Herod</hi>'s juriſdiction, he ſent him back to <hi>Herod,</hi> who was alſo himſelf at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in thoſe days. And <hi>Herod,</hi> ſeeing Jeſus, was very glad, for he was deſirous a long time to ſee him, for becauſe he heard many things of him, and he hoped to ſee ſome ſign wrought by him. And he asked him in many words; but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him nothing. And there ſtood the Chief Prieſts and the Scribes conſtantly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him. And <hi>Herod,</hi> with his army, ſet him at nought; and he mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and ſent him back to <hi>Pilate.</hi> And <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were made friends that day, for before they were enemies one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And <hi>Pilate,</hi> calling together the Chief Prieſts and Magiſtrates and the People, ſaid to them, you have preſented to me this man, as averting the people, and behold, I, examining before you, have found no cauſe in this man, of thoſe things wherein you accuſe him; no,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:110737:69"/>nor <hi>Herod</hi> neither, for I ſent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him. I will chaſten him therefore and diſmiſs him. And of neceſſity had to releaſe unto them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the feaſt-day, one. But the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude together cryed out, ſaying, Diſpatch him, and releaſe to us <hi>Barabbas;</hi> who was, for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſedition, made in the city, and murder, caſt in priſon. And <hi>Pilate</hi> again ſpake to them, deſirous to releaſe Jeſus. But they cryed again, ſaying, Crucifie, crucifie him. And he the third time ſaid to them, Why, what evil hath he done? I find no cauſe of death in him; I will correct him therefore, and let him go. But they were inſtant with loud voices, requiring, that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed. And <hi>Pilate</hi> adjudged their petition to be done. And he releaſed unto them, him that for murther and ſedition had been caſt into priſon, whom they demanded; but Jeſus he delivered to their pleaſure. And when they led him, they took one <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the countrey, and they laid the croſs upon him to carry after Jeſus. And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, which bewailed and lamented him. But Jeſus turning to them, ſaid, Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> weep not upon me, but weep upon your ſelves, and upon your children; For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the days ſhall come, wherein they will ſay, Bleſſed are the barren, and the wombs that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:110737:69"/>have not born, and the paps that have not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuck. Then ſhall they begin to ſay to the mountains, Fall upon us, and to the hills, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us. For if in the green wood they do theſe things, in the dry what ſhall be done? And there were led alſo other two malefactors with him to be executed. And after they came to the place, which is called <hi>Calvari,</hi> there they crucified him; and the thieves, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. And Jeſus ſaid, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, did caſt lots. And the people ſtood expecting, and the Princes with them derided him, ſaying, Others he hath ſaved, let him him ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if this be Chriſt, the Elect of God. And the ſouldiers alſo mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, ſaying, If thou be the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſave thy ſelf. And there was alſo a ſuperſcription written over him in <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters, This is the King of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And one of thoſe thieves that were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying, If thou be Chriſt, ſave thy ſelf, and us. But the other anſwering, rebuked him, ſaying, Neither doſt thou fear God, whereas thou art in the ſame damnation? And we indeed juſtly, for we receive worthy of our doings; but this Man hath done no evil. And he ſaid to Jeſus, Lord, remember me when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdom. And Jeſus ſaid to him, Amen I ſay
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:110737:70"/>to thee; This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe. And it was almoſt the ſixth hour; and there was made darkneſs upon the whole earth until the ninth hour. And the ſun was darkned, and the veil of the Temple was rent in the midſt. And Jeſus, crying with a loud voice, ſaid, Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit. And ſaying this, he gave up the Ghoſt.</p>

Firſt, We ought to beg of God, what may conduce to our ſalvation. Secondly, We ought to ask it in the Name of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; for there is no other Name given to men by which they can be ſaved. Thirdly, We muſt have a firm faith in God's omnipotence. Fourthly, We are to look upon God as our Judge, who gives to every man according to his works, and therefore the confidence wherewith we pray, is grounded upon the teſtimony of our conſcience, that it is not guilty of any thing which may render us unworthy to preſent our ſelves
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:110737:74"/>before his Divine Majeſty. Fifthly, We muſt place all our confidence in God's mercy, in the verity of his promiſes, and not in our merits. Sixthly, We are to beg the grace, to love juſtice, ſo that no perſecution whatever may cauſe us to ſwerve from it. Seventhly, We muſt not deſire puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the wicked, out of hatred or revenge, but out of charity for their correction, as long as there is hopes of their amendment, and to the end, that others, by their chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may fear to imitate them, and that, the empire of ſin being overcome, God alone may reign in this world. Eightly, We ought to beg, that the adverſities and misfortunes of this life, may not deject us, nor proſperity charm our ſenſes and affections, but that we may rely upon God, and glorifie him. Ninthly, And to glorifie God as we ought, we muſt offer up our ſelves to him in the ſpirit of ſacrifice and annihilation, that is of Pennance. Tenthly, The ſervice and duty we offer up to God muſt be free not ſervile. Eleventhly, We muſt acknowledge our ſelves unable to make a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and true offering of our ſelves, if the grace God do not deliver us from our ſins, which we muſt pray for from our very hearts.</ab>

Fourthly, That to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us worthy of this grace of perſeverance, in the obedience of divine law, we ought to meditate continually upon it; it muſt be the object of our entertainment, and we muſt have a greater care and pleaſure to accompliſh it, than world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covetous men have to get and preſerve their periſhing riches.</ab>

God brings to their knowledge, that this life is but as death, that ſo they may be brought to find out the true life, which conſiſts in knowing and loving him. 2. He ſhews them, that in this world men are intangled in ſin and ignorance, to the end to raiſe them to a deſire to be enlightened by his grace. 3. God inſpires them with a conſideration, that this life is but a baniſhment, that looking upon themſelves as ſtrangers and exiled perſons, ſurrounded with ambuſhes, enemies, and miſeries, they may thirſt after their true country, which is Heaven. 4. God exerciſes the Faithful by perſecutions and other traverſes, that ſo he may bring them to conform and ſubmit to his will. 5. He often permits them to be perplext and diſquieted, to humble and make them ſenſible of their own weakneſs, and the want they have of God's continual aſſiſtance, to the end they make their addreſſes unto him, placing all their hopes in his mercy,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:110737:75"/>and not in their own ſtrength. 6. God frees them from ſin, and confirms them in vertue, dilates and enlarges their hearts by filling them with his love, that they may with exact diligence and fervent perſeverance walk in his paths.</ab>

Secondly, He teaches us that this divine wiſdom renders us more knowing than our Maſters, when we love him more than they; for our Maſters are his Diſciples as well as we. It is a Maſter which not onely makes us know good, but gives us alſo the will and power to do it. Conſequently, the Prophet tells us the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this divine wiſdom. It makes us flie and hate ſin, and to delight in the Law of God. By it we put on a firm reſolution to keep the Commandments; by it we order our lives well, and

He exhorts us, to beſeech his Majeſty, not to leave his gifts imperfect; but that, illuminating our Spirit, we may truly underſtand his Law, and obſerve his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Commands. Secondly, He bids us conſider, that God would not, that his Holy Law ſhould be written and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to us in vain; but to be as a ſure Guide to our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Therefore we beg, that our Conſciences reproach not our Deeds, for being uncomfortable to our knowledge. Thirdly, He ſhews us, how deplorable their condition is, who follow other Rules, and lead their Lives by other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes than what the Law of God preſcribes. Fourthly, The Prophet tells us, with what purity we ought to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon the Holy Scriptures, which contain the Law of God, forbearing, either in Thought or Word, all ſort of Error, or Lying, that ſo we may neither deceive, nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Fifthly, He minds us of our Frailty and Miſery; which yet muſt not diſcourage us, ſince God Almighties Grace gives us ſtrength and power to perform his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</ab>

Thirdly, That we muſt conſider, that as in the beginning of a ſpiritual courſe of life, we are to enter

And, as we are to begin courageouſly, ſo to go on with more vigour; not regarding what the Fleſh can, but what the Spirit will do, according to what the Word of God ordains, putting all our confidence in his divine aſſiſtance. Fourthly, That the diſlike, which we ought to have of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with drawing themſelves from God, and conſequently from their Salvation, in not obeying his Commandments, ſhould move us to walk with more vigilance and fervour towards perfection: Since not to go forward is to go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.

Fourthly, Their ſouls muſt be ſo tranquil, as not to be diſcompoſed with any traverſes of this world. Fifthly, We ought to groan after their ſalvation. Sixthly, They muſt conſider God is preſent in all their actions. Seventhly, They muſt have a hearty ſorrow for their paſt ſins; and give God thanks, that he hath freed them from them. They ought likewiſe to conſider, that God ſought them, when as yet they ſought not him; and that he ſought them, to the end they might

Firſt begins a Sermon; the Biſhop, in his Robes, accompanied with his Clergy, gives the Abſolution, and all upon their knees ſing the <hi>Miſerere mei Deus,</hi> with the Verſes and Prayers following. This Ceremony is a ſign of the Sacramental Abſolution, which heretofore was given to thoſe ſinners who had done Penance in the Lent. And this day is alſo called Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution Thurſday, becauſe Penitents are then abſolved, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to participate of the Euchariſt, it being that day on which Jeſus Chriſt inſtituted it: and thereby the Church ſhews us, that at preſent ſhe inflicts not ſo ſevere Penances now as formerly, yet ſhe teaches them to do fruits worthy of Penance, that they may be admitted to participate of this Holy Sacrament, on this day, whereon Chriſt our Saviour began, by his Paſſion, the Work of our Redemption to God his Father.</ab>

For he knew who he was that would betray him, therefore he ſaid, You are not clean all. Therefore, after he had waſhed their feet, and taken his garments, being ſet down again, he ſaid to them, Know you what I have done to you? You call me Maſter, and Lord; and you ſay well, for I am ſo; if then I

                     <ab type="commentary">This Pſalm, out of which our bleſſed Saviour, when nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Croſs, repeated the firſt words, containeth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of his Paſſion; where, after the Royal Prophet hath repreſented Pains and Sufferings of the Son of God, after he hath ſpoken of his Glory, and of the grandeur of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and related the benefits accuring to the Faithful, for which they ought to be thankful, this Divine Saviour, who was himſelf impeccable, putting himſelf in our ſtead, and, taking our obligations upon him, making our debts his own, ſatisfying for our crimes, teacheth us in this Pſalm, that the ſins of mankind, which he took upon himſelf, did merit, that his Father ſhould abandon him to all imaginable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby to make rigorous ſatisfaction to his juſtice, and that in theſe words, when he ſaith, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> ſpeaks not in his own perſon, but as in the unhappy infirmity of our fleſh, which he hath taken upon him, and on the behalf of the members of his myſtical body, whoſe groans and prayers, to his Father and Himſelf, he foreſaw, through a propenſion of humane nature, deſirous to be freed from ſufferings and death. For who can believe our Saviour ſhould deſire to avoid death, and ſufferings, ſince he came into the world for that end? Or who can imagine he ſpake in ſuch ſort, as if that which happened, had been againſt his will, who had power to give up his ſoul to God, and to take it again, though
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:110737:102"/>no man had power to bereave him of it. Theſe words then, of this One and twentieth Pſalm, are a figure of ſuch Prayers as ſhall be addreſt to God by men, in their afflictions, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to be freed of them: Conſequently, the Son of God ſhewing us, that his Eternal Father hath not delivered him from the power of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who purſued him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and outrages, even to death, as he preſerved <hi>Noah</hi> from the deluge, <hi>Lot</hi> from the fire that fell from Heaven, <hi>Iſaac</hi> from the ſword lifted up to cut off his head, <hi>Joſeph</hi> from the ſlander of a woman, and the horrour of a priſon, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> from the fury of the <hi>Egyptians, Raab</hi> from the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the City of <hi>Jericho, Suſanna</hi> from the impoſture of the falſe witneſſes, <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Lyon's den, the three <hi>Hebrew</hi> Children from the fiery furnance, inſtructs us thereby, that we ought to deſire, what we are to ask by the grace of the New Teſtament; and that the end, for which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chriſtians, is not for this temporal life, wherein God often delivers us up to perſecutors, who perſecute us even to death, but that the Name of Chriſtian entitles us to an Eternal Life, conſidering that he, whoſe Name we bear, was treated ſo for us.</ab>

The entire and unſpotted Paſchal Lamb ſignified, that he, who as a ſacrifice was one day to be immolated for us, ſhould be pure and free from all ſpot or ſin. The blood of this Lamb, wherewith the Gates of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were ſprinkled, to prevent the deſtroying Angel from invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in the ſame ſlaughter with the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was a ſign, that the blood of Chriſt ſhould be ſhed for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſins of God's people. The injunction of not breaking a bone of the Paſchal Lamb, ſignified, that not a bone of Chriſt ſhould be broken upon the Croſs; to ſhew the force and power of his divinity.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:110737:109"/> As God inſtituted the Paſche, and commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to eat the Paſchal Lamb, in memory of the Miracles he had done for them in <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo his Son Jeſus Chriſt inſtituted the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body and blood, in memory of what he had done for us in his Paſſion. The <hi>Jews,</hi> in eating the Paſchal Lamb, were in a poſture of travellers, to mind them, that they were upon the point of flying out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the land of <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſtanding upright, having their ſhooes on, with a ſtaff in their hands, and to eat it haſtily. With how much more diligence and activity ought we to eat the Divine Lamb of the New Law, ſince we are to make a longer Voyage, <hi>viz.</hi> from Earth to Heaven? The <hi>Jews</hi> were not to eat the Paſchal Lamb, but with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread; to teach us, that we cannot eat, as we ought, our Paſchal Lamb, (whereof theirs was but onely a figure) unleſs we puriſie our hearts from all filth, becoming as a new paſte, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaven; that is, without ſin. The <hi>Jews</hi> did eat the Paſchal Lamb with wild Lettice, to ſignifie the grief we ought to have for our ſins; and the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we muſt conceive to expiate them, whereby to paſs hence to heaven. The number of perſons, which the <hi>Jews</hi> were to call to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to eat the Paſchal Lamb, was a figure of that charity we ought to bear to each other; to the end we may worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partake in this Sacrament, of the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt. It was commanded, not to eat any thing of this Lamb, that was raw; to teach us, that we are not to eat the body of our Lord, without the due preparation, which God requires of us. It was prohibited to be eaten boiled in water, and onely to be eaten roaſted; to inſtruct us, that our love of God ought to be pure in our hearts; whereby to make us worthy to eat the fleſh of this Divine Lamb, without engaging our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon the tranſient pleaſures of this life, figured by water, in the Holy Scripture. The <hi>Jews</hi> did eat the head, feet, and entrails of the Paſchal Lamb; to tell us, that we muſt ſincerely and firmly believe, not only the divinity of Chriſt, figured by the head, but his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, figured by the feet, and all the more hidden myſteries of our faith, repreſented by the entrails. The blood of this Paſchal Lamb was ſprinkled on the two ſide-poſts, and upon the upper door-poſt of the houſe, in form of a croſs; to ſignifie, that by the croſs and blood of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:110737:109"/>Chriſt, we are delivered from the tyranny of the devil, and ſervitude of ſin. And it was further to ſignifie, that to receive worthily this Sacrament of the Paſſion of our Saviour, we muſt not onely take it with our mouths, but with our hearts, deſigning to imitate him by the practice of good works. In fine, All that remained of this Paſchal Lamb was caſt into the fire, and burnt, to obſerve unto us, that when we find our ſelves incapable of eating this Sacrifice, entirely through weakneſs of ſpirit, or doubting, whether that which we ſee, be the body of our Saviour, which the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not able to behold, we are not then to continue longer in that doubt, but caſt it into the fire of the holy ſpirit, that it may be there conſumed, ſince our weakneſs is not able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. If not then, when we conſider, that the things, that ſeem impoſſible unto us, ceaſe not to become poſſible by the vertue of the Holy Ghoſt.</ab>
                     <p>IN thoſe days our Lord ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> in the land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> This month ſhall be to you the beginning of months: it ſhall be the firſt in the months of the year. Speak ye to the whole aſſembly of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſay to them, The tenth day of this month let every man eat a lamb by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and houſes: But if their number be leſs, then may ſuffice to eat the lamb, he ſhall take unto him his neighbour, that joyneth to his houſe, according to the number of ſouls which may ſuffice to the eating of the lamb. And it ſhall be a lamb without ſpot, a male of a year old; according alſo unto which rite you ſhall take a kid. And you ſhall keep him until the fourteenth day of this month: and the whole multitude of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall ſacrifice him at even. And they ſhall take of the blood thereof, and put upon both the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:110737:110"/>poſts, and on the upper door-poſts of the houſes wherein they ſhall eat him. And they ſhall eat the fleſh that night roaſted at the fire, and unleavened bread with wild lettice. You ſhall not eat thereof any thing raw, nor boiled in water, but onely roaſted at the fire: the head, with the feet and entrails thereof, you ſhall devour. Neither ſhall there remain any of him till morning: if there be any thing left, you ſhall burn it with fire: And thus you ſhall eat him: You ſhall gird your reins, and you ſhall have ſhooes on your feet, holding ſtaves in your hands, and you ſhall eat ſpeedily; for it is the phaſe (that is, the paſſage) of our Lord.</p>

                     <ab type="commentary">The Paſſion is read in the Pulpit, being uncovered; firſt, to ſhew us, that Chriſt was nailed all naked to the Croſs: ſecondly, to ſignifie, that Jeſus Chriſt has ſhewed unto us, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly and manifeſtly, the accompliſhment of the Propheſies: and 'tis for this reaſon alſo, that this day the Crucifixes are all unvail'd.</ab>
                     <p>AT that time Jeſus went forth with his diſciples beyond the torrent <hi>Cedron,</hi> where was a garden, into which he entred and his diſciples. And <hi>Judas</hi> alſo, that betrayed him, knew the place, becauſe Jeſus had often reſorted thither, together with his diſciples. <hi>Judas</hi> therefore having received the band of men, and of the chief prieſts and the phariſees, miniſters cometh thither with lanthorns, and torches, and weapons. Jeſus therefore, knowing all things that ſhould come upon him, went forth, and ſaid to them, Whom ſeek ye? They anſwered him, Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> Jeſus ſaid to them, I am he. And <hi>Judas</hi> alſo, that betrayed him, ſtood with them. As ſoon therefore as he ſaid to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. Again there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:110737:111"/>he asked them, Whom ſeek ye? And they ſaid, Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> Jeſus anſwered, I have told you, that I am he: if therefore you ſeek me, let theſe go their ways, that the word might be fulfilled which he ſaid, That of them, whom thou haſt given me, I have not loſt any. <hi>Simon Peter</hi> therefore, having a ſword, drew it out, and ſmote the ſervant of the high prieſt, and cut off his right ear. And the name of the ſervant was <hi>Malchus.</hi> Jeſus therefore ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> put up thy ſword into thy ſcabbard: The chalice which my father hath given me, ſhall not I drink it? The band therefore, and the tribune, and the miniſters of the <hi>Jews,</hi> apprehended Jeſus, and bound him: and they brought him to <hi>Annas</hi> firſt, for he was father-in-law to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> who was the high prieſt of that year. And <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was he that had given counſel to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that one man die for the people. <hi>Simon Peter</hi> followed Jeſus, and another diſciple. And that diſciple was known to the high prieſt, and went in with Jeſus into the court of the high prieſt. But <hi>Peter</hi> ſtood at the door without. The other diſciple therefore, that was known to the high prieſt, went forth, and ſpake to the porters, and brought in <hi>Peter.</hi> The wench therefore, that was portreſs, ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> Art not thou alſo of this mans diſciples? He ſaid to her, I am not. And the ſervants and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſtood at a fire of coals, becauſe it was
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:110737:112"/>cold, and warmed themſelves. And with them was <hi>Peter</hi> alſo ſtanding, and warming himſelf. The high prieſt therefore asked Jeſus of his diſciples, and of his doctrine. Jeſus anſwered him, I have openly ſpoken to the world: I have always taught in the ſynagogue, and in the temple, whither all the <hi>Jews</hi> reſort toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and in ſecret I have ſpoken nothing. Why askeſt thou me? Ask them that have heard me, when I have ſpoken unto them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they know what things I have ſaid. When he had ſaid theſe words, one of the miniſters, ſtanding by, gave Jeſus a blow, ſaying, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereſt thou the high prieſt ſo? Jeſus anſwered him, If I have ſpoken ill, give teſtimony of the evil; but if well, why ſtrikes thou me? And <hi>Annas</hi> ſent him bound to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> the high prieſt. And <hi>Simon Peter</hi> was ſtanding, and warming himſelf, they ſaid therefore to him, Art not thou alſo of his diſciples? He denied, and ſaid, I am not. One of the ſervants of the high prieſt, (coſin to him whoſe ear <hi>Peter</hi> did cut off) ſaith to him, Did not I ſee thee in the garden with him? Again therefore <hi>Peter</hi> denied. And forthwith the cock crew. They therefore bring Jeſus from <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> into the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. And it was morning, and they went not into the palace, that they might not be conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, but that they might eat the Paſche. <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore went forth to them without, and ſaid, What accuſation bring you againſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:110737:112"/>this man? They anſwered and ſaid to him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee. <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore ſaid to them, take him you, and, according to your law, judge him. The <hi>Jews</hi> therefore ſaid to him, It is not lawful for us to kill any man. That the word of Jeſus might be fulfilled which he ſaid, ſignifying what death he ſhould die. <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore went into the palace again, and called Jeſus, and ſaid to him, Art thou the king of the <hi>Jews?</hi> Jeſus anſwered, Sayeſt thou this of thy ſelf, or have others told it thee of me. <hi>Pilate</hi> anſwered, Why, Am I not a <hi>Jew?</hi> Thy nation and the chief prieſts have delivered thee up to me: What haſt thou done? Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, My Kingdom is not of this world: if my Kingdom were of this world, my mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters verily would ſtrive, that I ſhould not be delivered to the <hi>Jews;</hi> but now my Kingdom is not from hence. <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore ſaid to him, Art thou a King then? Jeſus anſwered, Thou ſayeſt, that I am a King. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world, that I ſhould give teſtimony to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaith to him, What is truth? And when he had ſaid this, he went forth again to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſaid to them, I find no cauſe in him. But you have a cuſtom, that I ſhould releaſe one to you in the Paſche: Will you therefore, that I releaſe unto you the King of the <hi>Jews?</hi> They
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:110737:113"/>all therefore cryed again, ſaying, Not him, but <hi>Barabbas.</hi> And <hi>Barabbas</hi> was a thief. Then therefore <hi>Pilate</hi> took Jeſus, and ſcourged him. And the ſouldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it upon his head: And they put about him a purple garment. And they came to him, and ſaid, Hail, King of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and they gave him blows. <hi>Pilate</hi> went forth again, and ſaid to them, Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may know, that I find no cauſe in him. Jeſus therefore went forth, carrying the crown of thorns, and the purple veſtment. And he ſaid to them, Lo the man. When the chief prieſts therefore and the miniſters had ſeen him, they cryed, ſaying, Crucifie, crucifie him. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid to them, Take him you, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him, for I find no cauſe in him. The <hi>Jews</hi> anſwered him, We have a law, and, according to that law, he ought to die, becauſe he hath made himſelf the Son of God. When <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore had heard this ſaying, he feared more. And he entred into the palace again: and he ſaith to Jeſus, Whence art thou? But Jeſus gave him no anſwer. <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore ſaith to him, Speakeſt thou not to me? Knoweſt thou not, that I have power to crucifie thee, and I have power to releaſe thee? Jeſus anſwered, Thou ſhouldeſt not have any power againſt me, unleſs it were given thee from above. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that hath betrayed me to thee, hath the greater ſin. From thenceforth <hi>Pilate</hi> ſought
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:110737:113"/>to releaſe him. But the <hi>Jews</hi> cryed, ſaying, If thou releaſe this man, thou art not <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s friend. Every one that maketh himſelf a King, ſpeaketh againſt <hi>Ceſar.</hi> But <hi>Pilate,</hi> when he had heard theſe words, brought forth Jeſus, and he ſate in the judgment-ſeat, in the place that is called <hi>Lithoſtrotos,</hi> and in the Hebrew <hi>Gabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha.</hi> And it was the Paraſceve of the Paſche, about the ſixth hour. And he ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Lo your King. But they cryed, Away with him, away with him; Crucifie him. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid to them, Shall I crucifie your King? The chief prieſts anſwered, We have no King, but <hi>Ceſar.</hi> Then therefore he delivered him unto them for to be crucified., And they took Jeſus, and led him forth. And, bearing his own croſs, he went forth into that which is called the place of <hi>Calvari,</hi> in Hebrew <hi>Golgotha;</hi> where they crucified him, and with him two others, on the one ſide, and on the other, and in the midſt Jeſus. And <hi>Pilate</hi> wrote a title alſo, and he put it upon the croſs. And it was written, Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the King of the <hi>Jews.</hi> This title therefore many of the <hi>Jews</hi> did read, becauſe the place where Jeſus was crucified was nigh to the city, and it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin. The chief prieſts therefore of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid to <hi>Pilate,</hi> Write not the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but that he ſaid, I am the King of the <hi>Jews. Pilate</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That which I have written, I have
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:110737:114"/>written. The ſouldiers therefore, when they had crucified him, took his garments (and they made four parts, to every ſouldier a part) and his coat. And his coat was without ſeam, wrought from the top throughout. They ſaid therefore one to another, Let us not cut it, but let us caſt lots for it, whoſe it ſhall be. That the Scripture might be fulfilled, ſaying, They have parted my garments among them, and upon my veſture they have caſt lots. And the ſouldiers did theſe things. And there ſtood beſide the croſs of Jeſus, his mother, and his mother's ſiſter, <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalene.</hi> When Jeſus therefore had ſeen his mother and the diſciple ſtanding, whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he ſaith to his mother, Woman, behold thy ſon. After that, he ſaith to the diſciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the diſciple took her to his own. Afterward Jeſus knowing that all things were now conſummate, that the ſcripture might be fulfilled, he ſaith, I thirſt. A veſſel therefore ſtood there full of vinegar, and they putting a ſpunge full of vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar about hyſop, offered it to his mouth. Jeſus therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, ſaid, It is conſummate, and, bowing his head, he gave up the ghoſt.</p>

But after they were come to Jeſus, when they ſaw that he was dead, they did not break his legs, but one of the ſouldiers, with a ſpear, opened his ſide, and incontinent there came forth blood and water. And he that ſaw it, hath given teſtimony: and his teſtimony is true. And he knoweth, that he ſaith true, that you alſo may believe.

                     </p>
                     <ab type="commentary">This Adoration is not terminated in the wood of the Croſs, but in Jeſus Chriſt faſtened thereon. The Ceremony is very ancient: For, beſides that it is ſet forth in the <hi>Roman</hi> Order, and in St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Book of the Sacraments, St. <hi>Paulinus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nola,</hi> (the immortal Ornament and Native of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>) living in the Fourth Age, mentions it in his 11 Epiſtle to <hi>Severus Sulpicius.</hi> The publick Prayers being ended, the Prieſt puts off his Caſuble, and takes the Croſs; to repreſent Jeſus Chriſt naked, and loaded with his Croſs. Then he uncovers it at three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times; to ſhew us, how the Goſpel was ſpred (firſt) in a little corner of <hi>Judea;</hi> and for that cauſe the Prieſt begins to unvail the Croſs, on the right ſide, and beneath the Altar, ſinging,</ab>
                     <p>BEhold the Wood of the Croſs.</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">And the Quire anſwers,</ab>
                     <p n="R">
                        <hi>R.</hi> Come let us adore.</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">Secondly, The Goſpel was preached publickly to the <hi>Jews,</hi> figured by the right ſide of the Altar: and therefore the Prieſt, coming to the right corner of the Altar, uncovers the right arm, and the head of the Crucifix, ſaying again,</ab>
                     <p>Behold the Wood of the Croſs:</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">The Quire anſwering,</ab>
                     <p n="R">
                        <hi>R.</hi> Come let us adore.</p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:110737:119"/>
                     <ab type="commentary">Thirdly, The Goſpel was preacht to the whole world; and therefore the Prieſt goes to the middle of the Altar, and unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Crucifix entirely, ſaying,</ab>
                     <p>Behold the Wood of the Croſs, whereon the Saviour of the World is faſtened.</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">The Quire anſwer again,</ab>
                     <p n="R">
                        <hi>R.</hi> Come let us adore.</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">Then the Prieſt puts the Croſs in a convenient place, for the people, he firſt beginning this Ceremony, in three times kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to the ancient cuſtom in the <hi>Roman</hi> Order. And, after the Prieſt, the reſt of the Clergy and people follow in the ſame manner. During the Ceremony the <hi>Triſagion</hi> is ſung both in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> and <hi>Greek;</hi> being taken from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as you may read in the firſt Seſſion of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> in his 14th Book, and 46th Chapter; and by it the Church offers to our meditation, that Chriſt, dying for us, according to his humanity, is the living, invincible, and immortal God, by his Natural and Divine Perſon. Then the following Verſes are ſung, taken out of the Prophets, and particularly out of <hi>Michaeas,</hi> which contain the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches our Saviour made to the <hi>Jews</hi> for their ingratitude.</ab>

Then the Prieſt riſing up, puts Incenſe into the Cenſors, without bleſſing it: then kneeling again, he takes one of the Cenſors, and incenſeth the Holy Sacrament. Then the Deacon, taking the Chalice, wherein the bleſſed Sacrament is, out of the Tabernacle, he puts it into the Prieſts hands, who covers it with the ends of the vail, that is upon his ſhoulders; and ſo they go in order as they came: the Prieſt, with the bleſſed Sacrament, under the Canopy; the two Acolytes incenſing; and all the people ſinging this Hymn.</ab>

After this, he puts the conſecrated Hoaſt upon the Corporal, without any words, or making the ſign of the Croſs.

John Lateran</hi>'s, becauſe formerly the Pope was accuſtomed there to bleſs the Fonts, and ſolemnly adminiſter Baptiſm. The Altars are made ready, and the Canonical hours ſaid, but no Tapers lighted till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Maſs; in the mean time without the Church fire is ſtruck out of a Flint, and Coals alighted therewith. The Prayer of the None being ended, the Prieſt in his Albe with a ſtole and pluvial of a violet colour, accompanied with his Miniſters, goes before the Church-gate, there to bleſs the new fire, the Sub-deacon carrying the Croſs, and the Acolyts Holy Water, the Thurlble without fire, the Box with Frankincenſe and five Grains of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, in a Baſon for the Paſchal Candle. The unlighted Candles ſignifie, that the Old Law hath been fulfilled and conſummated by Jeſus Chriſt. The new fire from the flint without teaches us that Jeſus Chriſt, figured by the flint-ſtone, is come to infuſe the fire of his Divine Love into the World by his Death, which he ſuffered without the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> deſiring that it may enlighten our hearts, as he himſelf teſtifies in the 12th.

                     <p>Let us Pray.</p>
                     <p>O Almighty Father, never-failing Light, Creator of all light, bleſs this light which is ſanctified and bleſt by thee, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneſt the whole World, that we may be thereby enlightened and inflamed.

                     <p>Let us Pray.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, Holy Father, Omnipotent Eternal God, vouchſafe to co-operate with us, who bleſs this fire in thy Name, and in the Name of thy Son our Lord, and of the Holy

                     <ab type="commentary">The fire being bleſt, the Prieſt alſo bleſſeth the five grains of Incenſe, to repreſent the perſumes which the devout Women brought to our Saviours Sepulcher, and being fixt to the Paſchal Candle, they repreſent the five wounds in our Saviours Body, the ſcars whereof he would retain after his Reſurrection.</ab>
                     <ab type="commentary">This bleſſing is performed, to ſignifie that God by the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt his Son (who brought the light of his Grace to the World) ſanctifies all Creatures which the Devil makes uſe of to draw us into ſin, and that by the Merits of this our Saviour, the Church applies her bleſſings and prayers againſt the aſſaults of the Devil, that in all places we may make a right uſe of them.</ab>
                     <ab type="commentary">And therefore in former Ages this Ceremony was uſed the Night following at the Midnight Maſs, about which time Chriſt roſe again, to mind us of the new light of the World received by his Reſurrection.</ab>
                     <p>O God Almighty, pour forth we beſeech thee, thy abundant bleſſings upon this Incenſe, and renewing the world by an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible regeneration, enlighten this night, that not onely the Sacrifice, which is offered this night, may ſhine by a ſecret mixture of thy ſplendour, but alſo, that, in whatever place any part of the Myſtery of this ſanctification ſhall be brought, all ſurpriſe and malice of the Devil being chaſed away, the vertue of thy Majeſty may be aſſiſted. Through Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <ab type="commentary">Then the Prieſt puts Incenſe into the Cenſor and bleſſes it, proteſting by this bleſſing that adoration is due to God alone, and beſeeches him that his prayers may riſe as Incenſe unto him.</ab>

                     <ab type="commentary">Then the Prieſt ſprinkles the Incenſe and new fire with the Holy Water, to ſhew us that we ought to cleanſe our ſelves of our ſins, that we may be capable of the new light which Chriſt hath brought to the World, and therefore he ſaith,</ab>
                     <p>THou ſhalt ſprinkle me, O Lord, with hyſſop, and I ſhall be cleanſed; thou ſhalt waſh me, and I ſhall be made whiter than ſnow.</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">Then the Deacon putting on a white Dalmatick, to repreſent the Angels who declared Chriſts Reſurrection; takes a Cane whereunto three ſmall Candles are fixed in a triangle, which he lights one after another, to inſtruct us that the Light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel which Jeſus Chriſt hath brought unto us, is the work of the bleſſed Trinity, to whom we are to render thanks.</ab>
                     <ab type="commentary">And therefore advancing towards the Altar, he thrice repeats</ab>
                     <p>Behold the light of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>Vouchſafe, Father, to bleſs.</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">The Prieſt, bleſſing him, ſaith,</ab>
                     <p>OUr Lord be in thy lips, that thou mayeſt worthily and competently declare the

                     </p>
                     <ab type="commentary">Then the Deacon, taking the Cenſor out of the Acolyts hands, incenſeth the Book thrice, in honour of the Holy Trinity, which the light of the Goſpel revealed unto us, as we are taught by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. And inviting the Faithful to give God thanks for the Victory which his Son Chriſt Jeſus gained over the Devil, and for the favour done unto them, by drawing them from darkneſs and ſervitude of ſin, by the light of the Goſpel, repreſents unto them, that their joy ought to be common to them and to the Angels, who rejoyce to ſee, that their number (leſſened by the fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his complices) is filled up again by humane nature, renewed and repaired by Jeſus Chriſt.</ab>
                     <ab type="commentary">Then the Deacon, acknowledging his own unworthineſs, joyns in Prayer with the Church.</ab>
                     <p>MAy the angelical troops now rejoyce; may the divine myſteries be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a holy joy; may the ſound of a comfortable trumpet publiſh the victory of ſo great a King; and may the whole earth be ſenſible of the bleſſing it had, by the ſplendour of the the Eternal King, who freed it from that darkneſs which overſpread the whole World. May our Mother, the Church, rejoyce alſo at the glympſe of ſo reſplendent light; and may this place reſound with the voices of this Congregation: And therefore I beſeech ye, my beloved Brethren, here preſent, who, enlightened with the admirable ſplendour of this holy light, joyn with me, and call upon our Merciful and Almighty God, to the end, that as he hath been pleaſed, not through my
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:110737:130"/>merits, to advance me to the number of his <hi>Levites,</hi> ſo ſhedding the beams of his light upon me, he will give me grace to perfect the praiſe of this Paſchal Candle. Through, <hi>&amp;c. Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <ab type="commentary">The Benediction and Praiſe of the Paſchal Candle is very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, for this Ceremony is mentioned in <hi>Prudentius</hi> his Hymn, who lived in the fourth Age, and St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzenus,</hi> and St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
                     </ab>
                     <ab type="commentary">Then the Deacon prepares the Faithful to celebrate this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony worthily with him, adviſing them to lift up their hearts to God, and to quit all affections to Creatures, acknowledging the grace they have received of God by the Light of his Goſpel, which is repreſented by the Candle.</ab>

                     <p>Let us give thanks to our Lord.</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">The Faithful anſwer, that it is juſt and reaſonable, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they give publick thanks by the Deacon, and particular reſentments of their hearts by following in their minds the words which the Deacon uſes.</ab>
                     <p n="R">
                        <hi>R.</hi> It is meet and juſt.</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">The Deacon exhorts the Faithful to give God thanks for that in this Night by the glorious Reſurrection of his Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Merits of his Death he had freed us from
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:110737:131"/>the Tyranny of the Devil, and from the Bondage of Sin, wherein our firſt Parent by his ſin had involved us; and for that by the light of his Goſpel he had conducted us to the Kingdom of Heaven, which he had promiſed to his faithful Servant, as he delivered the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of the Captivity of <hi>Egypt,</hi> cauſing a Pillar of Fire to lead them into the Land of Promiſe.</ab>
                     <p>IT is truly meet and juſt, that with all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our heart and ſoul, and with the miniſtry of our voice, we glorifie the inviſible God, Father Almighty, and his onely Son, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath paid <hi>Adam</hi>'s death for us to his Eternal Father; and, by ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his innocent blood, hath blotted out the hand-writing of our old ſins, whereby we are ſubjected to death: For theſe are the Paſchal Feaſts wherein the true Lamb is immolated, and the gates of the Faithful conſecrated by his blood. This is that night wherein firſt thou madeſt our forefathers, the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to paſs the Red Sea dry-foot. This is that night which diſſipated the darkneſs of ſins, by the light of a pillar of fire. This is that night, which ſeparating through the whole World thoſe that believe in Jeſus Chriſt, from the vices of this age, and from the darkneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſinners are ingaged, reſtores them to grace, and aſſociates them to ſanctity. This is that night, wherein the chains of death being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, Chriſt aſcended Conquerour from Hell. For it would not have availed us to have been born, unleſs Chriſt had been pleaſed to redeem us. O God, how admirable is thy bounty
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:110737:131"/>towards us! how ineſtimable thy charity! who didſt deliver up thy Son to redeem thy ſlave. O certain neceſſary ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> to make us ſenſible of the exceſs of God's love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us! ſince it hath been effaced by the death of Jeſus Chriſt. O happy fault, that merited to have ſuch and ſo great a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer! O truly happy night, which alone deſerved'ſt to obſerve the time and moment of Chriſt his riſing from the dead! This is that night of which it is written in the 178th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> The night ſhall ſhine as the day, and the night is my illumination in my delights, therefore the ſanctification of this night baniſheth all crimes, waſheth away all offences, reſtores to innocence thoſe that had been loſt, makes glad the afflicted, reconciles hatred and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, reſtores peace and union, and humbles em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires.</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">Here the Deacon puts the five grains of bleſt Incenſe in form of a Croſs into the Candle not yet lighted, which ſignifies the dead Body of our Saviour, teaching us how adorable the wounds were which he received on the Croſs, where he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Sacrifice for us to God his Father, whereof the Evening Sacrifice was a figure in the Old Law, and the Sacrifice of the Altar is a repreſentation of it in the Evangelical Law. Then the Deacon lighting the Candle, which then becomes a figure of Chriſts Body riſen again, acknowledges the advantage we have received by his Reſurrection.</ab>
                     <p>REceive then, O Holy Father, from us, on this happy night, the Evening-Sacrifice of this Incenſe, which thy Holy Church, by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:110737:132"/>its Miniſters, renders unto thee in the Solemn Oblation of this Wax Candle, made of the work of Bees. And now we acknowledge the praiſe-worthy Benefits of this Pillar, lighted from the ſparkling fire, to the honour of God.</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">Then the Deacon lights the Candle with one of the three Cierges on the Cane, to ſignifie that Jeſus Chriſts Reſurrection, as alſo his Incarnation and Paſſion, was the work of the whole Trinity (whoſe works are inſeparable) though the only Perſon of the Son became Incarnate, ſuffered Death, and roſe again commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the glory of his Reſurrection and Graces neceſſary to obtain it without the leaſt diminution to himſelf, to thoſe who are regenerated and formed in his Church, as this Wax which is employed to the Service of God.</ab>
                     <p>WHich (fire) though it be divided, yet loſeth it not any thing in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of its light, feeding it ſelf from the melted Wax, which the Bee hath produced, to make the ſubſtance of this precious touch.</p>
                     <ab type="commentary">Here the Lamps and Tapers are all lighted with the new fire, to repreſent the light and grace which Jeſus Chriſt hath poured forth upon his Faithful in his Reſurrection, carrying away the ſpoils of Hell, whereof the <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſpoils born away by the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at their going forth of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were a figure. And the Deacon magnifying the benefits of Gods bounty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches his Majeſty to beſtow them upon all Orders which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the body of his Church.</ab>
                     <p>O Night, truly bleſſed, wherein the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> were pillaged, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> enricht with their ſpoils. The night wherein celeſtial and terreſtial, divine and humane things were conjoyned. We beſeech thee therefore, O Lord,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:110737:132"/>that this Candle, conſecrated to the honour of thy Name, may, without ceaſing, diſſipate the darkneſs of this night, and that its light, aſcending as an acceptable perfume, may mix with the celeſtial lights.

We beſeech thee therefore, O Lord, that, granting us peace in our days, thou wilt vouchſafe, amidſt theſe Paſchal-Feaſts, to lead us as thy ſervants, to govern and protect us continually, with thy whole Clergy, and all thy Faithful, our Holy Father, the Pope, and our Biſhop. Regard likewiſe our King, <hi>N.</hi> and, knowing the deſires of his heart, grant, O God, by the ineffable grace of thy bounty and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that he may enjoy a tranquillity of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual peace, and, together with his people, a heavenly victory: By the ſame our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt thy Son, who liveſt and reigneſt with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghoſt, one God, world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <p>IN the beginning God created heaven and earth. And the earth was void and vacant, and darkneſs was upon the face of the depth. And the ſpirit of God moved over the waters. And God ſaid, Be light made. And light was made. And God ſaw the light, that it was good; and he divided the light from darkneſs. And there was evening and morning, that made one day. God alſo ſaid, Be a firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made amidſt the waters: And let it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide between waters and waters. And God made a firmament, and divided the waters, that were under the firmament, from thoſe that were above the firmament. And it was done ſo. And God called the firmament, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And there was evening and morning, that made the ſecond day. God alſo ſaid, Let the waters, that are under the heaven, be gathered
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:110737:133"/>together in one place: And let the dry land appear. And it was ſo done. And God called the dry land, earth; and the gathering of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters together, he called ſeas. And God ſaw that it was good. And ſaid, Let the earth ſhout forth green herbs, and ſuch as may ſeed; and fruit-trees, yielding fruit after his kind, ſuch as may have ſeed in it ſelf upon the earth. And it was done ſo. And the earth brought forth green herb, ſuch as ſeeds according to his kind; and tree that beareth fruit, having ſeed each one according to his kind. And God ſaw that it was good. And there was evening and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that made the third day. Again, God ſaid. Be there lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and night, and let them be for ſigns and ſeaſons, and days and years; to ſhine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth. And it was done ſo. And God made two great lights; A greater light to govern the day, and a leſſer light to govern the night; and ſtars. And he ſet them in the firmament of heaven, to ſhine upon the earth, and to govern the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkneſs. And God ſaw that it was good. And there was evening and morning, that made the fourth day. God alſo ſaid, Let the waters bring forth creeping creature, having life, and flying foul, over the earth, under the firmament of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And God created huge whales, and all
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:110737:134"/>living and moving creature, that the waters brought forth according to each ſort, and all foul, according to their kind. And God ſaw that it was good. And he bleſſed them, ſaying, Increaſe and multiply, and repleniſh the waters of the ſea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth. And there was evening and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that made the fifth day. God ſaid more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Let the earth bring forth living creature in his kind, cattel, and ſuch that creep, and beaſts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was ſo done. And God made the beaſts of the earth, according to their kinds; and cattel, and all that creepeth on the earth, in his kind. And God ſaw that it was good: And he ſaid, Let us make man to our own image and likeneſs: let him have dominion over the fiſhes of the ſea, and the fouls of the air, and the beaſts, and the whole earth, and all creeping creature that moveth upon the earth. And God created man to his own image; to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them. And God bleſſed them, and ſaith, Increaſe and multiply, and repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it; and rule over the fiſhes of the ſea, and fouls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth. And God ſaid, Behold, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you all manner of herb that ſeedeth upon the earth, and all trees that have in themſelves ſeed of their own kind, to be your meat; and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:110737:134"/>to all beaſts of the earth, and to every foul of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was ſo done. And God ſaw all things that he had made; and they were very good. And there was evening and morning, that made the ſixth day. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens therefore and the earth were fully finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all the furniture of them. And the ſeventh day God ended his work, which he had made; and reſted the ſeventh day from all the work that he had done.</p>

                           <hi>NOE,</hi> when he was five hundred years old, begat, <hi>Sem, Cham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that men began to be multiplied upon the earth, and procreation of daughters, the ſons of God, ſeeing the daughters of men, that they were fair, took to themſelves wives out of all which they had choſen.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:110737:135"/>upon the earth in thoſe days. For after the ſons of God did company with the daughters of men, and they brought forth children: theſe be the mighty of the old world, famous men. And God, ſeeing the malice of men was much upon the earth, and that all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of their hearts was bent to evil at all times, it repented him, that he had made man upon earth. And touched inwardly with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of heart, I will (ſaith he) clean take away man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man, even to beaſts; from that which creepeth, even unto the fouls of the air: For it repenteth me, that I have made them. But <hi>Noe</hi> found grace before our Lord. Theſe are the generations of <hi>Noe. Noe</hi> was a a juſt and perfect man in his generations: He did walk with God. And he begat three ſons, <hi>Sem, Cham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet.</hi> And the earth was corrupted before God, and was repleniſhed with iniquity. And when God had perceived that the earth was corrupted, (for all fleſh had corrupted his way upon earth) he ſaid to <hi>Noe,</hi> The end of all fleſh is come before me: the earth is repleniſhed with iniquity from the face of them: and I will deſtroy them with the earth. Make thee an ark of timber-plank: cabinets ſhalt thou make in the earth, and ſhalt pitch it within and without with Bitume. And thus ſhalt thou make it. The length of the ark ſhall be three hundred cubits, fifty
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:110737:136"/>cubits the breadth, and thirty cubits the heighth of it. Thou ſhalt make a window in the ark; and in a cubit finiſh the top of it: and the door of the ark ſhalt thou ſet at the ſide below; middle chambers, and third loſts ſhalt thou make in it. Behold, I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth, that I may deſtroy all fleſh, wherein there is breath of life under heaven. All things that are in the earth ſhall be conſumed. And I will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh my covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt enter into the ark, thou and thy ſons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy ſons, with thee. And of all living creatures, of all fleſh, thou ſhalt bring pairs into the ark, that they may live with thee, of the male ſex and the female. Of fouls according to their kind, and of beaſts in their kind, and of all that creepeth on the earth, according to their kind: pairs of all ſorts ſhall enter in with thee, that they may live. Thou ſhalt take therefore with thee of all meats, that may be eaten, and thou ſhalt lay them up with thee; and they ſhall be meat for thee and them. <hi>Noe</hi> therefore did all things which God commanded him. And he was ſix hundred years old, when the waters of the flood overflowed the earth. Then all the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the great depth were broken up, and the flood-gates of heaven were opened; and the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights. In the very point of that day entred
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:110737:136"/>
                           <hi>Noe,</hi> and <hi>Sem, Cham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> his ſons, and his wife, and the three wives of his ſons, with them into the ark, they and every beaſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their kind; and all cattel in their kind, and all that moveth upon the earth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their kind; and all foul, according to their kind. Moreover, the ark floted upon the waters. And the waters prevailed out of meaſure upon the earth: and all the high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains under the whole heaven were covered. Fifteen cubits higher was the water above the mountains which it covered. And all the fleſh was conſumed, that moved upon the earth, of fowl, of cattel, of beaſts, and of all creepers, that creep upon the earth. But only <hi>Noe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and they that were with him in the ark. And the waters held on above the earth an hundred and fifty days. And God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred <hi>Noe,</hi> and all the beaſts, and all the cattel, which were with him in the ark; and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And the fountains of the depth, and the flood-gates of heaven were ſhut up, and the rain from heaven was ſtaid. And the waters returned from the earth, going and coming: and they began to decreaſe after an hundred and fifty days. And after that forty days were paſſed, <hi>Noe</hi> opened the window of the ark, which he had made, let forth a crow; which went forth, and did not return, till the waters were dried upon the earth. He ſent forth alſo
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:110737:137"/>a dove after him, to ſee if the waters were ceaſed yet upon the face of the earth; which finding not where her foot might reſt, returned to him into the ark; for the waters were upon the whole earth, and ſtretched forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark. And having expected yet ſeven more days, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he let forth a dove out of the ark: but ſhe came to him at eventide, carrying a bough of an olive tree, that had green leaves in her mouth. <hi>Noe</hi> therefore underſtood, that the waters were ceaſed upon the earth. And he expected never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs other ſeven days; and he ſent forth a dove, which returned not any more to him. And God ſpake to <hi>Noe,</hi> ſaying, Go forth of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy ſons and the wives of thy ſons with thee. All cattel which are with thee of all fleſh, as well in fowls as in beaſts; and all creepers, that creep upon earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth, encreaſe and multiply upon it. <hi>Noe</hi> therefore went forth, and his ſons, his wife, and the wives of his ſons with him. Yea, and all cattel, beaſts, and creepers, that creep upon the earth, according to their kind, went forth out of the ark. And <hi>Noe</hi> built an altar to our Lord; and taking of all cattel, and fowls that were clean, offered holocauſts upon the altar. And our Lord ſmelled a ſweet ſavour.</p>

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:110737:142"/>ſought it for their own Vertue, and in the fleeting Pleaſures and Wealth of this Life; who are perſuaded, that already they poſſeſs the Sovereign Good, and that, in fine, to obtain it, they ſought not God, nor placed their hopes in his infinite Goodneſs and Bounty; but that they are loſt in thoſe vain and proud thoughts. 'Tis from God alone, that hath made them, and can make them bleſſed; that can divert the evils of this Life, or ſweeten them, or give courage to ſupport them, or abſolutely free thoſe, that bow under the burthen: And who can at laſt elevate Man to the true fruition of this Bliſs; where no evil is to be feared, and where the ſovereign goodneſs is not to be loſt. And unto this end God hath given Law unto Men; wherein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and promiſing a recompence unto Pious Souls, he teaches us not to ſpend this temporal and uncertain Life in its Vanities and Pleaſures; but to ſuffer all ſorts of Afflictions and Torments, rather than to violate his Commandments, out of a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the fidelity of his Promiſes, and in hopes, after death, to enjoy Eternal Happineſs. And to enable us to obſerve the Law, it was his Will, that his Son ſhould come into this World. This Divine Saviour, covering the Grandeur of his Divinity under the Weakneſs of our Nature, hath taught us, by the example of his Paſſion, what Miſeries we ought to ſuffer in this World; and by his Reſurrection what Bleſſings to hope for in the next; giving us at the ſame time the grace to do and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that which he hath ſhewed us, if by our ſins we render not our ſelves unworthy.</ab>

Thou haſt forſaken the fountain of wiſdom. For if thou hadſt walked in the way of God, thou hadſt verily dwelt in peace everlaſting. Learn where wiſdom is, where underſtanding is, that thou mayeſt know withal, where is the long continuance of life
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:110737:142"/>and living; where the light of the eyes and peace is, who hath found the place thereof? and who hath entred into the treaſures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? where are the princes of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and they that rule over the beaſts, that are upon the earth, that play with the birds of heaven; that treaſure up ſilver and gold, wherein men have confidence, and there is no end of their getting? which faſhion ſilver, and are careful; neither is there invention of their works. They are deſtroyed, and are gone down to hell, and others are riſen up in their place. Young men ſaw the light, and dwelt upon the earth, but the way of diſcipline they knew not, neither underſtood they the paths thereof; neither have their children received it. It is made far from their face.

But the way of wiſdom they have not known; neither have they remembred the paths thereof. O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how great is the houſe of God, and how great is the place of his poſſeſſion! It is great, and hath no end; high and unmeaſurable. There were the gyants, thoſe renowned that were from the beginning of big ſtature, expert in war. Theſe did not our Lord chuſe, neither found they the way of diſcipline, therefore did they
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:110737:143"/>periſh. And becauſe they had not wiſdom, they periſhed through their folly. Who hath aſcended into heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds? Who hath paſſed over the ſea, and found her, and brought her above choſen gold? There is none that can know her ways, nor that can ſearch out her paths; but he that knoweth all things, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her, and hath found her out by his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; he that prepareth the earth in time everlaſting, and repleniſhed it with cattel, and four-footed beaſts: he that ſendeth forth light, and it goeth, and hath called it, and it obeyeth him with trembling. And the ſtars have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven light in their watches, and rejoyced: they were called, and they ſaid, Here we are: and they have ſhined to him with chearfulneſs, that made them.

                        <ab type="commentary">In this Leſſon the Church propoſes unto us the Ceremony of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſſover explicated before (<hi>pag.</hi> 197.) to inſtruct us, that Jeſus Chriſt, having fulfilled the Solemnity of the old Paſch, celebrated in memory of the delivery of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, came to this new Paſch, which he is pleaſed, that his Church ſhould ſolemnize, in memory of the Redemption he brought to the World, giving his Body and Bloud in lieu of the Fleſh and Bloud of the Paſchal Lamb. And for the better obſervance of the greatneſs of this Benefit, and to preſerve the memory of it, God hath commanded, that whereas before we reckoned the years from the Creation of the World, from henceforth we ſhould compute them from this deliverance, to make us underſtand thereby, that the delivery of Man from the Tyranny of the Devil, and Slavery of Sin (which the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage was a figure of) is not leſs conſiderable, yea, is more advantageous to us than our Creation.</ab>
                        <p>IN thoſe days our Lord ſaid unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> this month ſhall be to you the beginning of months; it ſhall be the firſt in the months of the year. Speak ye to the whole aſſembly of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſay to them; the tenth day of this month let every man take a Lamb by their Families and Houſes. But if the number be leſs than may ſuffice to eat the Lamb, he ſhall take unto him his Neighbour that joyneth to his Houſe, according to the number of ſouls which may ſuffice to the eating of the Lamb. And it ſhall be a Lamb without ſpot, a Male, of a year old: according alſo to which rite
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:110737:146"/>you ſhall take a Kid. And you ſhall keep him till the fourteenth day of this month; and the whole multitude of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall Sacrifice him at even. And they ſhall take of the bloud thereof, and put upon both the Poſts of the Houſes wherein they ſhall eat him. And they ſhall eat the fleſh that night roſted at the fire, and unleavened bread with wild lettice. You ſhall not eat thereof any thing raw, nor boyled in water; but only roaſted at the fire: the head with the feet, and entrails thereof, you ſhall devour: and you ſhall not break one bone of him. Neither ſhall there remain any thing of him until morning. If there be any thing left, you ſhall burn it with fire. And thus you ſhall eat him. You ſhall gird your reins; and you ſhall have ſhooes on your feet, holding ſtaves in your hands; and you ſhall eat ſpeedily. For it is the Phaſe (that is, the paſſage) of our Lord.</p>

Secondly, to teſtifie, that we ought not to be leſs ſenſible of the Benefits received from God by the Merits of his Son, than the Saints of the Old Teſtament, to whom God had revealed them, the Church ſays the 116 Pſalm. Thirdly, the Church teaches us, that in commemorating the Burial and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, we ought to preſent unto our Saviour the perfumes of our Prayers and Good works, in imitation of the Charity and Zeal of thoſe good Women, who came to his Sepulcher at Day-break, with their Perſumes, to pay him the Duty of their Piety.

Wherein the Church, relating what happened at our Saviours Sepulcher at his Reſurrection, teacheth us what we ought to do to prepare our ſelves for the celebrating worthily this Solemnity, and then propoſes to us the advantages we reap. 1. This Goſpel teacheth us, that the three <hi>Maries</hi> went early in the Morning with Perfumes to ſeck Jeſus Chriſt in his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. The Example of theſe Holy Women tell us our obligation of going to ſeek for Chriſt in his Sepulcher, as ſoon as we are enlightned with his grace: That is, in the Sacrament of Penance, which is the figure of it, there to bury our ſins, making a ſtock of Good Works, ſignified by the Perfumes. 2. Theſe Holy Women had the happineſs to ſee the Angels, to teach us, that the Souls which ſeek Chriſt with Holy deſires, and the Odour of Vertues, have a particular aſſiſtance from the Bleſſed Spirits. 3. The Angel appeared to theſe Holy Women in white, as a token of Innocence and Joy, to tell us with what purity and joy we are to ſolemnize the Reſurrection of our Lord. This Joy is common to us with the Angels; who rejoyce becauſe the void places of their Hierarchies are repleniſhed; and we ought to rejoyce, for that by its vertue we are raiſed in this World from the death of ſin to a life of grace; and we receive a pledge of happy Immortality, whereunto we aſpire. 4. The Angel appeared ſitting on the right hand, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, that by Chriſts Reſurrection we are called to poſſeſs Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings, expreſſed in Holy Scripture by the right hand. 5. Theſe Holy Women were ſurpriſed with fear at their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, but afterwards were emboldned by the Angel. To teach us, that Souls which ſeek God carefully, and are toucht with a Holy fear, which is the firſt gift of the Holy Ghoſt, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with Celeſtial conſolations. 6. The Angel recommended to theſe Holy Women to publiſh our Saviours Reſurrection, namely, to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to ſhew us the Providence which God hath for true Penitents, and the hope he gives them to partake of the Glory of his Sons Reſurrection.</ab>

And, entring into the monument, they ſaw a young man ſitting on the right hand, covered with a white robe.

                     </p>
                     <ab type="commentary">That which the Royal Prophet foretold in this Pſalm, of the Myſtery of the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, the Church propoſes unto us, according to the Explication left us by the Apoſtles, as well in the Book of their Acts, and in their Epiſtles, as in the Book of Goſpels. Firſt, She repreſents us with the Sufferings and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110737:189"/>Death of Jeſus Chriſt; which the Prophet compares to an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of the Waters, and to a Tempeſt, and to a Wreck. Secondly, She preſents us with the Prayer which our Saviour made to God his Father at the acceſs of his Grief, when in the condition of a Slave (which our Infirmities occaſion'd) being in appearance forſaken of God his Father, ſince in his Sufferings he denied him that which he deſired through a propenſion of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, wherewith he was clothed; drawing from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his Heart theſe Words, full of Love and Piety, <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be poſſible, let the Chalice of my Sufferances paſs without my drinking it; however, thy will be done, not mine.</hi> That which he earneſtly deſired, 'tis that made his Innocency appear, and that he voluntarily ſuffered thoſe Pains for the Sins of Men, and not for his own, having never committed or been able to commit the leaſt Sin. And though his Paſſion ſeems ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and is an Object of Scandal and Abomination in the judgment of the Jews and Gentiles, yet the Faithful are not thereat troubled. Thirdly, The Church ſhews us, that in this Pſalm the Prophet foretells how our Saviour was to be betrayed by one of his Diſciples, and abandoned by his others, and how many Outrages and Contempts the Jews would caſt upon him. Fourthly, In this Pſalm is declared the Zeal Jeſus Chriſt had for the Honor of his Father, his Reſignation to his Father's Will, his Submiſſion to his Conduct, and his Contempt of his own proper Intereſt: For ſo the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the fifteenth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> explicates one part of this Pſalm. Fifthly, According to St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles;</hi> and of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in this Pſalm is deſcribed the Puniſhment which was prepared for the Traytor <hi>Judas,</hi> and the other Perſecutors of Jeſus Chriſt, wherewith this adorable Saviour threatens them, not through any Hate or Revenge, but through the Zeal of God's Juſtice, conſidering the Reprobation of thoſe Wretches in the Decrees of his Providence. Sixthly, We are inſtructed in this Pſalm, That Jeſus Chriſt having by his Death repaired the Honor of God his Father, he was alſo to riſe again and build his Church, which through Sin was loſt, and eſtabliſh his Faithful in the poſſeſſion of the Heavenly Inheritance ſignified by <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and loſt by Sin: Eſtabliſhing on Earth a more agreeable Sacrifice than that of Calves (which was offer'd him in the Old Law) to wit, the Sacrifice of his own Body and Blood.</ab>

But the Council of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi> held about the Year 364, forbad to celebrate in the Churches this Ceremony of the <hi>Agapes,</hi> for the Irreverences that might be committed; and ſoon after the Apoſtles time they never communicated but faſting, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> witneſſeth.</ab>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110737:208"/>muſt never deſpair of Gods Mercy, but always acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that though their Sins are never ſo great, yet that his Mercy is far greater. <hi>David</hi> received the Sacraments of the Law and Circumciſion, whereby the Sins wherein he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived were taken away; he alſo received Holy Unction, and God promiſed unto him, that from his Loins the Meſſias ſhould be born, and that he and his Son ſhould build his Temple: And in the mean time <hi>David</hi> becomes an Adulterer and Murderer; but being touched afterwards with a true Penitence and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction of Heart, he cried for Mercy unto God, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Secondly, The Church ſhews us, That all Sinners muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Example of <hi>David,</hi> and put their whole confidence in the Mercy of God; that they muſt always acknowledge their Sins, and ever have them before their Eyes: For will not God vouchſafe to forgive thoſe Sins which Man will not acknowledge? They muſt conſider, that God eſteems thoſe Injuries done to their Neighbors as if done to himſelf; and therefore we ought to render an Account only to him. They muſt look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Lepers, and People rejected and ſeparated from other Men, as impure Men, as Strangers and Profane. They ought to have a pure and ſincere Heart: They muſt ſhake off the Old Man, to be renewed in God; that is, they muſt contemn all Pleaſures of the Fleſh, all Voluptuouſneſs, and all Popular Praiſe, and ſettle their whole Love on things inviſible and entirely Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. And it is not ſufficient only to correct their Lives, and ſin no more; but they muſt alſo ſatisfie unto God for their paſt Sins and Offences, by a true Compunction, by humble Sighs, by offering up a contrite Heart, and by Alms, which muſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany all the Exerciſes of Penance. They muſt ſuffer all things with Patience and invincible Courage, accepting and receiving their Puniſhments as juſt Pains for their Crimes. And in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding any Favours or Graces from God, they ought not to think they merit them, but only propoſe to themſelves to honor his Magniſicence and Bounty, that he may be acknowledged faithful to his Promiſes, in hearing the truly Penitents; and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproachable in his Judgment, by chaſtiſing Sinners. Laſtly, They muſt edifie their Neighbor by the Example of their good Lives, and endeavor the Converſion of the Wicked: They muſt beg of God that their Sins may not be the Cauſe that others ſhould be deprived of the Goods God would have granted unto them by their Interceſſion, if they had not rendred themſelves unworthy of that Miniſtry; as we ſee that <hi>David</hi> ask'd of God, that the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110737:208"/>Promiſes he had made to him to employ him in the building of his Temple, ſhould not be without effect; although himſelf was unworthy that Grace, yet that he would pleaſe to grant his Son the favour of finiſhing that great Work: <hi>Deal favourably,</hi> O <hi>Lord, in thy good will with Sion, and let the walls of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem be built up.

                     <ab type="commentary">Our Lord JESUS CHRIST pronounced the firſt Words of this Pſalm when he was faſtned to the Croſs; and they contain the Prophecy of his bitter Paſſion. And the Royal Prophet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving repreſented the Pains and Sufferings of the Son of God, then ſpeaks of his Glory and Empire; and at laſt ſhews us the Advantages that accrue unto the Faithful, and for which they ought to render Thanks unto God. This Divine Saviour, who could not be guilty, having put himſelf in our place, incurred our Obligations, contracted our Debts, and ſatisfied for our Crimes. Likewiſe this Pſalm preſents unto us, That the Sins of Men, wherewith he had loaded himſelf, deſerved that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould abandon him to all imaginable Miſery, that thereby he might ſatisfie the Rigor of his Juſtice in all things; and if he addreſſed this Complaint, <hi>My God, my God, Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> it was not in his own Perſon he ſpoke it; but in the Perſon of this wretched Infirmity of the Fleſh, wherewith He was clothed; 'twas in the Perſon of the Members of his Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body, foreſeeing the Deſires and Demands they would offer to his Father and himſelf, by an inclination of Nature, and by a Human Motion of being delivered from Torments and Death. For, What did our Saviour deſire to be delivered from Sufferings aad Death, who came only to that end into this World? Or why did he ſpeak thus, as if what hapned unto him was againſt his will, he who had power to render his Soul to God, and to take it again, without any ones being able to take it from him? Theſe Words therefore of this Pſalm repreſent thoſe who in their Miſeries pray unto God to be freed from them. Moreover God ſhews us, that his Eternal Father did not free him from the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110737:219"/>Power of the Jews, (who ſcoffed and ſcorned him to death) as before he had ſaved <hi>Noe</hi> from the Deluge, <hi>Lot</hi> from the Fire from Heaven, <hi>Iſaac</hi> from the Sword that threatned his Head, <hi>Joſeph</hi> from a Womans ſlanderous Accuſations and the horror of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Moyſes</hi> from the Fury of the <hi>Egyptians, Rahab</hi> from the Deſtruction of his City in <hi>Jericho, Suſanna</hi> from falſe Witneſſes, <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Den of Lions, the Three young <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the Flames that environ'd them: Whereby he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us what we are to deſire and beg by the Grace of the New Teſtament; and he teacheth us, that the End for which we are Chriſtians, is not to enjoy Happineſs in this temporal Life, wherein God often leaves us to the Rage of our Enemies; but that 'tis the Eternal Life which under the Name of Chriſtians we muſt endeavour to attain unto; conſidering, that he from whom we take that Name, was uſed in ſuch like manner before us.</ab>

Tenthly, The Service we offer unto God muſt be free, and not ſervile or conſtrain'd. God muſt be ſerved with a full and entire Affection. Eleventhly, We muſt likewiſe acknowledge we cannot have this Will, unleſs the Grace and Spirit of God deliver us from our Evils; therefore with our whole heart we muſt beg it of him.</ab>

There is this difference 'twixt <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s and our Sufferings, that ours depends not always on our own Will: It is neceſſary that we one day muſt die, which being due to our Sins, is of Neceſſity and Juſtice. But <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> did not ſuffer Torments and Death becauſe he would, and when he would, and after that manner as it pleaſed him; and being the ſame God with his Eternal Father, he could not die and remain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways equally in his Glory.

The Son of God, becauſe of his Form God (being of the ſame Eſſence with his Eternal Father): The Son of Man, becauſe he took on him the Form of a Slave; having power to ſeparate his Soul from his Body, and to reſume it again, what could his Enemies then do againſt him? They killed his Body, but his Soul they could not touch. Be attentive: Our Lord was not contented to exhort the Martyrs only with his Words, but would alſo fortifie by his Example.</p>

By no means. Becauſe <hi>Pilate</hi> pronounced Sentence againſt him, and commanded him to be crucified, he is guilty of his Death. And ye, O Jews, have put him to death; and how have ye put him to death?

For in the firſt place, JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST being willing to give unto Man a New Teſtament, it was alſo but requiſit that it ſhould be firm and unalterable, the which to render it, 'twas neceſſary he ſhould die; for the Wills and Teſtaments of Men take no effect till after their Death; for whilſt they live they may either change or abſolutely cancel them. Secondly, The New Teſtament was to correſpond with the firſt; neither was the Fire given without the effuſion of Blood, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in <hi>Exod. chap.</hi> 24.</ab>
                     <p>ANd therefore he is the mediator of the new teſtament: that death being a mean unto the redemption of theſe prevarications which were under the former teſtament, they that are called may receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance. For where there is a teſtament, the death of the teſtator muſt of neceſſity come between: for a teſtament is confirmed in the dead: otherwiſe it is yet of no value whilſt the teſtator liveth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon neither was the firſt certes dedicated without blood.</p>
